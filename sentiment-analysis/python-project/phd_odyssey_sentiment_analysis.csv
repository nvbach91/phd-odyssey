25,"In this interview with Jo Havemann, Luca reflects on the fundamental differences between arts and science, what it means to be the only artist in the lab, and how the two disciplines mutually enrich each other",Luca-Forcucci
26, We are here today with Luca Forcucci  from Switzerland and he's an artist and also a scientist,Luca-Forcucci
27, In this episode he will tell you more about how he became an artist as a scientist,Luca-Forcucci
28, Welcome Luca! Hi my name is Luca Forcucci and I am very happy to be here by the river Spree with a nice sun in front of us,Luca-Forcucci
29," I have a PhD in music, technology and innovation also known as Sonic Arts",Luca-Forcucci
30, There's a comma between music and technology by the way,Luca-Forcucci
31," I became involved in this research after a Master in Sonic Arts, studying mainly in Belfast is the UK and in Leicester; I got my PhD from De Montfort University",Luca-Forcucci
32, Before that I studied architecture so I have a diploma in architecture and I have practiced for 20 years but I have always been involved in music meaning I had a record contract very early and I played concerts for many years in Switzerland,Luca-Forcucci
33," I am used to production and research of artists, but I also have been involved in what is called Electroacoustic Music",Luca-Forcucci
34, Meaning neo-music or new music,Luca-Forcucci
35, When I started my PhD right after my master studies I got a grant from the Swiss government,Luca-Forcucci
36, That grant was part of a program called the Swiss artists in labs that would put artists into scientific labs in Switzerland for 9 months,Luca-Forcucci
37, Then the idea was to see what kind of outcome can come from this research and interactions,Luca-Forcucci
38,  I was in the laboratory of cognitive neuroscience in Switzerland which is part of the Brain Mind Institute,Luca-Forcucci
39, I was working with Professor Olaf Blanke,Luca-Forcucci
40, His main research back then was about out-of-body experiences,Luca-Forcucci
41," The idea was to see how we can handle prosthetics, so various issues and so on",Luca-Forcucci
42," Most of the research is conducted to have virtual imagery, meaning the integration of this in the brain is multimodal so the idea was to see what's the role of the sound so we conducted research on that part",Luca-Forcucci
43," Right after that program, I started my PhD which was directed into the arts, Sonic Arts",Luca-Forcucci
44," With this idea of how we perceive sounds, what's the role of embodiment into sound and personally I was interested in mental imagery: What kind of mental imagery there would be in the mind of a person when this person will listen to a particular sound or particular composition or particular sound installation",Luca-Forcucci
45,"  Obviously, everyone has a personal historical background and memory of course but it was interesting to see if particular space or architectural space would be represented by the brain and if we can find patterns",Luca-Forcucci
46, What kind of sounds are you using for your studies?  I used mostly sounds from my expedition e,Luca-Forcucci
47,g the Brazilian Amazon rainforest,Luca-Forcucci
48," I stayed there for two weeks with indigenous peoples, rainforest sounds, sounds from cities like Shanghai but also sounds from the body and how they interact between each other",Luca-Forcucci
49,  And then to observe how people react to these sounds?  Exactly and for this I had to train people because there's a big difference between hearing a sound and listening to a sound,Luca-Forcucci
50, It was pointed out by the philosopher  Roland Barthes,Luca-Forcucci
51, Hearing is a physiological act whereas listening is a psychological act,Luca-Forcucci
52, I had to train people to listen and to have a dedicative listening in order to see those images and ask them what kind of architecture spaces we were seeing and then try to find if there were patterns,Luca-Forcucci
53,  Did you have a hypothesis in the beginning that you could prove right or wrong what the finding of the study would be?  Well I am not a neuroscientist but I'm working with them,Luca-Forcucci
54, What I perceived is the space that I found among those participants which was 30 people for each piece so it means 180 people in total,Luca-Forcucci
55," The pattern I saw was a very small space, my hypothesis is that space that they perceive is their own body",Luca-Forcucci
56,  So that was for the work during your PhD and what happened after the PhD? What was the subsequent plan after that?  The research was practice-based research mainly,Luca-Forcucci
57,  I did my PhD part time so it means it was six years because I wanted to keep my artistic career so it means many art tendencies and many commissions which sometimes became part of the research or not,Luca-Forcucci
58,"  Basically I was already working mainly and I worked before I had my own architecture office, I was entrepreneur, researcher, artist I was self-founded,  self-dedicated, self-research but published in a high impact factor journals but also exhibition and so on",Luca-Forcucci
59,"  So after the PhD it didn't make any difference I was still doing what I was doing during, before and after the PhD",Luca-Forcucci
60,"  I am still collaborating with the researcher from that period at the brain mind institute meaning that's I take their research, in french there is a word called ""scientisme"" I don't know how to translate it in German or english",Luca-Forcucci
61," It's a kind of science but pseudoscience you proclaim you make science, I don't want to do that",Luca-Forcucci
62," The idea is that I ask them their expertise, I'm making research, I work on very precise case and then develop from them into my artistic work",Luca-Forcucci
63, The idea it's not to vulgarize science with art but to possibly ask new questions because I think this friction between art and science can be very beneficial,Luca-Forcucci
64,"   This is accepted as well, Europe for example with the H2020 has released a wish to go toward that direction of course they want to develop, they have other ideas, like markets and scientist",Luca-Forcucci
65, The artists are there to bring creativity,Luca-Forcucci
66, Creativity is still naive and has to be defined,Luca-Forcucci
67, The friction between scientists and artists can be useful to change the angle not of research but to bring new ideas in both ways actually,Luca-Forcucci
68, In the sense that the scientific research influence my work and vice versa,Luca-Forcucci
69," Basically I'm continuing with my career as an artist  and I might join a research lab at some point more like a traditional academic, a postdoc or a program research",Luca-Forcucci
70, Sometimes you need to be in a one or two years program to really dive into a certain research,Luca-Forcucci
71," Actually you don't stop really, when I graduated I gave my thesis, I went to San Francisco I was invited by Leonardo Journal and Djerassi foundation and I spent one month with 14 artists and scientists and we didn't make research we were just living together, each one conducting his own ideas, exploring his own ideas",Luca-Forcucci
72, We would have ideas around the coffee machine or during a meal,Luca-Forcucci
73," Going back to the time during your PhD, were there people that come to mind that inspired you to pursue your passion or topics you're passionate about or experiences you had where you thought this is quite a challenge and where you found yourself struggling and got yourself out of that struggle again?  I met many people, a lot  because I was not stuck in the university where I studied I was there maybe five weeks a year, maximum",Luca-Forcucci
74, I will go to the university and discussed with my supervisor,Luca-Forcucci
75,  Because of today possibilities I was communicating more through Skype so I didn't have to be there,Luca-Forcucci
76," Meanwhile I was conducting my research in a residency like in Shanghai, Paris or here in Berlin",Luca-Forcucci
77,"  So I met a lot of people during this period of research, also different cultures in research in German university, Swiss university, French university, Chinese University, Brazilian universities",Luca-Forcucci
78," I had a very bright and large perspective on research in my field, in the arts and the struggle encounters by my peers, of course money wise but also supervisors wise",Luca-Forcucci
79," All the problem that PhD can encounter, that you can imagine",Luca-Forcucci
80, I saw most of them,Luca-Forcucci
81, I was able to find my path and discuss many things,Luca-Forcucci
82," Then of course it was a lot of inspiring people I was lucky enough to be in great university like EPFL in Switzerland, the brain mind institute in Berlin, the major lab in the world for cognitive science, in particular Olaf Blanke's lab",Luca-Forcucci
83, The interesting thing is that he comes from a family of artists as he's the only one that made it to Neuroscience,Luca-Forcucci
84," He was even teaching me Art, we were discussing for example this artist called Bruce Norman and he was using this artist that was working on alternative way to look at your body, Olaf Blanke was using this artworks from Bruce Norman to design his experiments",Luca-Forcucci
85,"   It was amazing because I was in a scientific environment, I had to be accepted  and I have to learn the vocabulary of course because it's super precise but on the other hand I was someone that was totally sympathetic to my research",Luca-Forcucci
86," The director of the Brain Mind Institute Pierre Magistretti was interested in opera and he had side project where he asked opera singer to sing opera with a certain mindset like sing a part of the opera sad, sing it with a positive image",Luca-Forcucci
87," It was great I was very lucky to be one year in such environment, it was like going to the Star trek's spaceship everyday  On the other hand I was really inspired by women I have to say because electroacoustic music emerge from a very white middle class western tradition and I always complained that there was not enough women and cultural diversity as well in the labs",Luca-Forcucci
88," I was lucky enough to meet a lot of women, composer that have to struggle like Pauline Oliveros, she's an icon just like John Cage which is a major figure in his field",Luca-Forcucci
89," I was able to meet her, she is a really generous person",Luca-Forcucci
90, I think there is less competition between women than man,Luca-Forcucci
91, She was a really amazing person and she really open my mind on many aspects about research and life,Luca-Forcucci
92," Also Ashilow Madre, she was my professor when I was doing my master in Belfast and she is great",Luca-Forcucci
93, Bonnild Ferrari which was the widow of Luke Ferrari  major composer,Luca-Forcucci
94," Evelyne Gayou part of the GRM, the GRM is the ""groupe de recherche musical"" at radio France in Paris, so many people",Luca-Forcucci
95," What did you learn from them, in particular from the women?  Generosity, creativity, less competition and more ideas Given that you have so much experience and had the chance to get insights into different cultures and their academic worlds literally spread around the world, is there a universal advise you could give to current PhD students? What you saw, what to be aware of? One thing mentioned was for example: Choose your supervisor wisely or: Challenge your supervisor",Luca-Forcucci
96, That's what other people often advise in our podcast but apart from that what's an advice you would give to PhD students around the world?  First of all you really need to choose your supervisor for his/her research and not only on his reputation,Luca-Forcucci
97," Reputation of course but you not necessarily have to have a star, a university star",Luca-Forcucci
98, It has to be someone that has experience but someone that you respect that is close to your preoccupation for your research,Luca-Forcucci
99, I don't think that this start system - to just put names next to yours - is a good idea because he/she is usually super busy so you won't see much of them,Luca-Forcucci
100, You have to make your own contribution,Luca-Forcucci
101, I have more experience with design and art  because I worked with it,Luca-Forcucci
102," It's a very old topic ""Art and Science"", they were not differentiated back then you had Marcel Duchamps whom was inspired by Heny Poincar",Luca-Forcucci
103," It goes back to the 12th century in Persia where researchers were also philosophers, poets, astronoms, there is nothing new",Luca-Forcucci
104, I would say just be original,Luca-Forcucci
105," Well, it's not really original to say that",Luca-Forcucci
106," Just find your way, open your mind, go out of the lab as well, meet people and discuss various way, challenge everything",Luca-Forcucci
107, The PhD was one of the best thing I did in my life,Luca-Forcucci
108,  Not per se but the adventure I went through during that period,Luca-Forcucci
109, You are already busy doing what you do but after you become even more busy and you want to have the time to experiment because there is other things coming,Luca-Forcucci
110," Take that time to experiment, and challenge the most you can because when you are out it is totally different, you are kind of cocoon you are a bit protected during the PhD That's also what you miss about the PhD periods to be able to try different things, fail and succeed and fail again it's nothing bad to fail rather than gaining experiences",Luca-Forcucci
111, Which you have not the freedom as much later on,Luca-Forcucci
112," That's part of the experience to fail of course, the more you fail the better",Luca-Forcucci
113," But after you have all the preoccupation because you have to go to the next step, it means other things maybe you want to build a lab",Luca-Forcucci
114," When you are in a PhD you are still free to try things, you have the time to do it",Luca-Forcucci
115, After you have to create your own time but it's a very privileged period I guess being in a PhD,Luca-Forcucci
116,"  Afterwards what's driving you now? Is work still a source from the time as a PhD students and how the things continue since, also following up of what's your plan for the next 3 to 5 years",Luca-Forcucci
117, I have my lab at some point,Luca-Forcucci
118," I would like to continue to travel, it is part of my project because I work with what I call ancestral technologies",Luca-Forcucci
119, I work with people in southern Africa,Luca-Forcucci
120, And I work in Brazil since 10 years,Luca-Forcucci
121," My question is what was the technology, what was the knowledge before the jesuite went there and destroyed all that knowledge",Luca-Forcucci
122, That knowledge is very important to me,Luca-Forcucci
123, We have a lot of technology today but that technology back then is probable very valuable,Luca-Forcucci
124,  At the moment I'm conducting this research calling ancestral technology and the perception of sounds,Luca-Forcucci
125, This include many things I won't discuss too much here but continue to travel explore all those opportunity,Luca-Forcucci
126,"  On the long term, I would like to have my lab possibly but my lab which is also my studio but sometimes I have it sometimes I don't",Luca-Forcucci
127," I'm really a nomade I go around, my lab, it's my luggage and sometimes I would like to establish more my things and be more ambitious",Luca-Forcucci
128, Anyway I'm happy with what I'm doing mainly I would like to be able to continue to do it,Luca-Forcucci
129," At the end there is also the funding part, how you design this economical side, until where you can go, what you would accept to get funding, sometimes you get funding but ethically would you accept them? is it okay or you just don't mind  just take it and go? That's the main point, you can be the most brilliant person on Earth but at some point you need funding",Luca-Forcucci
130," That is not a question of big amount but being able to work with people, build a team having a device",Luca-Forcucci
131, How you make it sustainable,Luca-Forcucci
132,  Sometimes you might have funding for one year and then the year after for thousands of reasons fundings are not available anymore,Luca-Forcucci
133," Is private funding good? Do you only work with states fundings, what's the difference? Until where you can go? I guess personally I think it's important and it's a lot of questions  It's either you are an entrepreneur or you are stuck in a lab and then you have the follow the "" publish or die"" rule, but is it still valid today?  Today continuing on that path there is many PhD and there is not as much positions so you have to think outside of the box, in another way, your career you have to be prepared to not make an academic career with your PhD",Luca-Forcucci
134," You might be open, your skills might be useful in the industry or in the arts in my case",Luca-Forcucci
135, Think that those skills might be transposed in another field and not necessarily in academia,Luca-Forcucci
136," Well, you do your bachelor, your master, your PhD and that maybe 3, 4, 5, 10 postdocs and then you become a professor, assistant professor, lecturer, I saw even assistant lecturer which is a very bad condition",Luca-Forcucci
137, You are not paid that well I haven't done it but I have colleagues that where assistant lectures not assistant professor! So you know it might be very precarious and you might not end up with professorship,Luca-Forcucci
138, Professors positions are very few,Luca-Forcucci
139, I am convinced that those skills are very useful and very valuable outside,Luca-Forcucci
140, There is an image of a doctor outside academia,Luca-Forcucci
141," People might be scared of that image we have to break that and say ""well look they are many other opportunities""",Luca-Forcucci
142," I know many people that work in the industry and they're very successful, they were very happy",Luca-Forcucci
143, A friend of mine works as physicist and he made is PhD on laser- very precise -  he worked on microscopes and now he works for a big American company for medical device but he is an engineer maybe for an engineer it's easier but what you do with a PhD in the humanities for example,Luca-Forcucci
144, I mean obviously you become a professor but again there is not so many available position,Luca-Forcucci
145," How you can transfer and transpose those skills, that's not discussed! I have the impression that the professor I know think it's agreed that you will become a professor or you will become a lecturer ",Luca-Forcucci
146," they don't prepare you to be something else, to be more flexible, it will be more and more like that",Luca-Forcucci
147," What's motivating you to continue to seek association with research from your own perspective so to say Well it's a need, I'm very interested by the brain how it works",Luca-Forcucci
148, it's a really deep interest as music is,Luca-Forcucci
149, So first you make art because it's a need you might make science because it's in need at that level it's it's like Formula One,Luca-Forcucci
150," Like a passion that comes, like a driving force it's really a need, it has to drive you, it has to be a really deep preoccupation I don't think that this kind of jobs is a 9 to 5 job",Luca-Forcucci
151," You go to sleep it's there, you wake up it's there",Luca-Forcucci
152, That's the main thing then,Luca-Forcucci
153, What do you think it's important to fuse science and arts to let them mingle to play around to take scientific questions with artistic interventions,Luca-Forcucci
154, And in your case audios For me it happen during my research  I've been thrown in a neuroscience lab,Luca-Forcucci
155," Then I study a bit this, it was my path and my interest",Luca-Forcucci
156, It's interesting because it gives new path and not only creativity,Luca-Forcucci
157,"  Today everything is creativity, we are really at the point where we should remove it from our CV because it doesn't mean anything anymore it's kind of overused",Luca-Forcucci
158, Everything is super specialized if you do a PhD you're super specialized,Luca-Forcucci
159, But here it opens a bit more the field and there's nothing new as I was saying before in Persia already at the 12 century people were studying astronomy poetry and so on,Luca-Forcucci
160, For example in China to be an intellectual you need not to be an intellectual,Luca-Forcucci
161," There's a tradition to be an artist, be in that intelligence I don't like this word intelligence it puts things above and I'm more horizontal thinking but anyway",Luca-Forcucci
162," Back then you have to study mathematics, calligraphy, poetry and music",Luca-Forcucci
163," It's is even older than our western thinking obviously you have Leonardo Da Vinci which I don't want to talk too much about, during the renaissance that was funded by the medici there is Marcel Duchamps closer working with Henry Pointcarr It's nothing new but now it's like a trend, it's more this idea of creativity and markets, which is a strange idea to me",Luca-Forcucci
164, There is also something that defines human beings,Luca-Forcucci
165," We are not only the physics and biology, and on the other side humanities",Luca-Forcucci
166," Further art and prouds that are parts of our lives but parts of the human being, culture, artistics",Luca-Forcucci
167, If you want to drive it into the top some people might argue that's what distinguishes us from the animals some biologist might intervene because animals are capable of conducting culture but that's a different story,Luca-Forcucci
168," It's part of us you can't really separate it, isn't it? You can't separate art from science",Luca-Forcucci
169, You know for certain questions yes but it's important to have the mix as well,Luca-Forcucci
170, At the end of the day science and art contribute to the same thing which is life,Luca-Forcucci
171," Or certain aspects of life but let's make it short we both studying the same aspect which is life, we have different methodology",Luca-Forcucci
172," We, the artist, look more for meaning and metaphor",Luca-Forcucci
173, It doesn't mean that is less important,Luca-Forcucci
174, At the end it is the same we tried to define things,Luca-Forcucci
175, It's a question of methodology,Luca-Forcucci
176," When you study science it's objective, third person perspective",Luca-Forcucci
177, What about subjectivity,Luca-Forcucci
178, First person perspective if you investigate behavior for example,Luca-Forcucci
179," What about what I feel inside me how do you study it? I would say very very roughly that should be amplified and observed more carefully but I would say that if sciences is the study through objective lens, art would be through a subjective lens",Luca-Forcucci
180, But it doesn't mean that subjectivity is less important for science,Luca-Forcucci
181," For some reason, historical reason we don't do that",Luca-Forcucci
182, We don't study subjectivity,Luca-Forcucci
183," Whereas it might be interesting of course it is more complicated, what kind of methodology do you use, you can't be inside one person",Luca-Forcucci
184," There is phenomenology, there's many many techniques",Luca-Forcucci
185, We have more knowledge with neuroscience for example,Luca-Forcucci
186,"    At the end it is how you make a fusion, how you combine science and art because if I investigate particular case I would need quantitative methodology but how do I mix with qualitative",Luca-Forcucci
187," How do I go to subjectivity, how do I investigate subjectivity",Luca-Forcucci
188," Both sides, art and science, it might bring new ideas new vision, new discovery",Luca-Forcucci
189," Well thank you, thanks so much",Luca-Forcucci
190, You're welcome,Luca-Forcucci
191,  ,Luca-Forcucci
192,"        True Story: I Dropped Out of My PhD Program  Thinking about dropping out of your PhD? Not sure that graduate program is right for you? You're  not alone! Today, my friend Erin is sharing the story of dropping out of her PhD",Erin's story - dropout

690," What a relief! I was dreaming about  this day for weeks, and am so glad it has finally arrived",Elena's story
691," Although I really hated the process of  writing this wretched report to begin with, by the end of it I actually acquired taste for it, and  saw the benefits",Elena's story
692," This important milestone in my PhD life made me reflect on my year of doctoral  studies , and the things that I should have done, or have done better! So I thought I would write  down some of my thoughts that might be useful for all those who have just started their PhD, and  want to avoid disappointment",Elena's story
693,  • Start with,Elena's story
694," When you start working on your project, the topic that you choose may be  too broad, and needs narrowing down",Elena's story
695," Well, make sure that you narrow it down to something that YOU  want to do for 3- 4 years, not something that your supervisors or advisors want but something that  YOU are really passionate about",Elena's story
696," My topic was too vague to begin with, and it took me ages to find  the right focus but now I am quite happy that I am working on a research project that will  contribute to the existing knowledge but at the same time can make a difference to policy and  practice! The only disappointment is that it took me too long to focus the topic",Elena's story
697, • Read more around the topic,Elena's story
698, The first year of your PhD is possibly the only time when you can  really plunge yourself into the world of reading,Elena's story
699," If you are lucky, you can make sense of it all  soon",Elena's story
700, before submission of your first report,Elena's story
701, I regret that I was not systematic with my  reading,Elena's story
702, bits and pieces here and there,Elena's story
703," Well, this probably reflects what a disorganised person  I am! But I am learning",Elena's story
704, So do be systematic! The books that I found really useful are  Doing a literature search and Doing a literature review by Chris Hart,Elena's story
705, They provide a pretty good  picture of how you should go about your reading and writing in the initial stages of your PhD,Elena's story
706,  Record everything you read and save references,Elena's story
707, There are a number of great web- based tools  available out there,Elena's story
708," I personally use Zotero for organising research papers, and Delicious for  bookmarking useful websites, blogs etc",Elena's story
709," Choose whatever suits you! But take my advice, start using  them from the very beginning, and it will save you loads of time later on",Elena's story
710, • Make a better use of your supervisors,Elena's story
711," One of my supervisors always says: We are not supervisors,  we are collaborators on your project! Only now I probably understand the full meaning of these  words",Elena's story
712, Don't simply sit and wait for your supervisors to tell you what to do (that's what I did at  the beginning),Elena's story
713," When working on collaborative projects, people challenge each other, share ideas,  and create solutions to the existing problems TOGETHER",Elena's story
714," Supervisors are members of your team! I  agree, your situation might be different, and some supervisors have a very traditional  Master-Apprentice approach",Elena's story
715," But still, the sooner you take the ownership of you project, the  better! Remember, in 5-6 months you will become an expert in your field! • Establish ‘love’ relationship with theory early on! What is the theory underpinning your study?  I've been struggling with this bit for a year! It's not relevant to all social science studies  since some of them adopt a grounded theory approach",Elena's story
716," But even to arrive at the conclusion that the  existing theories don't meet the needs of your study, you need to know them first",Elena's story
717, I thought I  hated theories until I started understanding them,Elena's story
718," It's actually really cool when you realise that  there is enough brain in your head to see the shortcoming of some theory, criticise it and try to  find an alternative approach",Elena's story
719, • Learn to manage yourself! Still struggling with this bit,Elena's story
720," PhD is the time when you learn so  much about yourself, the ways you prefer to work, and what motivates you to work",Elena's story
721," I am interviewing  PhD students just now, and a number of them mentioned that a key to success in your PhD is  DISCIPLINE! Can't but agree with  that",Elena's story
722, There is always a temptation to do some other things rather than concentrate on writing your  thesis chapter,Elena's story
723, Learn to set the priorities! Priority matrix by Steven Covey,Elena's story

821, Like starting a podcast or doing a PhD,Per-Olof-Arnäs
822, I was a student in mechanical engineering in the 1990s,Per-Olof-Arnäs
823," I took my degree in 1996, but mechanical engineering was not really my thing",Per-Olof-Arnäs
824, I just ended up there because I sort of crossed that program when I applied and that's where I ended up,Per-Olof-Arnäs
825," But during the third year of this five year education, I got the first taste of logistics, and I really found that interesting, and challenging, and that I was really good at it as well",Per-Olof-Arnäs
826," I started taking all of those courses, and when a PhD position opened in 1996 I applied for it",Per-Olof-Arnäs
827," No, actually, it was quite a conscious decision from my part",Per-Olof-Arnäs
828," The last year - to get into the department - I, actually did some extra teaching for them",Per-Olof-Arnäs
829," I worked extras as lab assistant and things like that, because I knew that I would like to do a PhD there",Per-Olof-Arnäs
830, When they open up a position and I applied for it and I got it,Per-Olof-Arnäs
831," Then I started doing my PhD, and I had no idea what it meant",Per-Olof-Arnäs
832, Maria: That is actually another question from me,Per-Olof-Arnäs
833, Is is there anything - now that you're looking back - that you wish you had known before you started to do your PhD? PO: Yes,Per-Olof-Arnäs
834, The importance of publications,Per-Olof-Arnäs
835, That was not important in the 1990s,Per-Olof-Arnäs
836," It was not really encouraged to write journal papers for us in our discipline, which ended up being a monograph instead of collection of papers, which was extremely difficult to write",Per-Olof-Arnäs
837," You have to write a book instead of writing papers, so most of the work is actually done it at the end instead of during the project",Per-Olof-Arnäs
838," If I had to do it all over again, I would have done a collection of papers and I would have aimed for the right journals and the right topics as steps on the path towards a PhD",Per-Olof-Arnäs
839," But that was the 1990s, nothing was the same then as it is now",Per-Olof-Arnäs
840, It's much much more different now,Per-Olof-Arnäs
841," Maria: If I understand correctly: after your PhD, you decided to leave academia",Per-Olof-Arnäs
842," PO: Actually, before",Per-Olof-Arnäs
843, Maria: Before - to take a job in the industry,Per-Olof-Arnäs
844," PO: In 1999, I did my license",Per-Olof-Arnäs
845," We have this intermediary degrees in Sweden, which is sort of halfway through the PhD process",Per-Olof-Arnäs
846," But, I would like to say it's 25 percent of the work, then 75 percent of the work on the content comes after that",Per-Olof-Arnäs
847," A lot of courses, saying that you're trained to craft the research - that's what you sort of doing the license for - that you can perform a study, you can do interviews and things like that",Per-Olof-Arnäs
848, And then I started on on my PhD project and I sort of shifted,Per-Olof-Arnäs
849," I started out working on dangerous goods, logistics effects of dangerous goods",Per-Olof-Arnäs
850," But then I started looking more into heterogeneous codes, more broadening the perspectives",Per-Olof-Arnäs
851," Then I also started a consultancy on the side, writing computer programs for the transportation industry, and that's when I came across object-oriented programming, which was a completely different topic from logistics",Per-Olof-Arnäs
852," I was wondering why it was so, because it was really useful - the modeling tools in the object-oriented programming world was really applicable in logistics, but no one had done it",Per-Olof-Arnäs
853, So I switched gears and started looking into object oriented modeling of transportation systems as a tool to understand them better,Per-Olof-Arnäs
854," Some people had done it but that was like five or six papers, some consultancy work, but it was quite an open field",Per-Olof-Arnäs
855," So I started looking into that, and I was almost finished - I was taking a bit longer",Per-Olof-Arnäs
856, Lots of the PhD students in my department was taking a bit more time than they actually should,Per-Olof-Arnäs
857," I was in 2002, which was then my sixth year",Per-Olof-Arnäs
858," We have this final seminar, which is supposed to be two months before PhD thesis is finished, where you have an external opponents, and all your colleagues",Per-Olof-Arnäs
859," The informal name for this is the""Pie throwing"" - where everyone tries to bring your thesis down as much as possible, so that you would have that feedback before your defense",Per-Olof-Arnäs
860, It's a sort of a dry run,Per-Olof-Arnäs
861, And after that the opponent and you write the report each and say this needs to be done and this is time plan,Per-Olof-Arnäs
862," Everyone signs off, and then you do the work, and a few months later you can publish your thesis",Per-Olof-Arnäs
863, I had this event in 2002 in December and in January I left the university,Per-Olof-Arnäs
864," Because I had this two months left of work ahead and I had a plan to do it, but I got the job offer from the industry",Per-Olof-Arnäs
865," I started working for the haulage industry in Sweden, in an R&D-based organization - those that once I've done consultancy work for",Per-Olof-Arnäs
866," So I started programming, and started educating, and I started doing a lot of things in the industry",Per-Olof-Arnäs
867," I had really a good time, and I made more money than I did as a PhD student, and all of a sudden it was 2006",Per-Olof-Arnäs
868," My employer asked me: ""Well, we hired a doctor - where is he?""",Per-Olof-Arnäs
869, And I actually had not stopped - I've been keeping the thesis afloat,Per-Olof-Arnäs
870," It was a monograph, so no papers",Per-Olof-Arnäs
871, It was just that things needed to fall into place,Per-Olof-Arnäs
872," Then in 2006, I said to my employer: ""I need two months",Per-Olof-Arnäs
873,""" So they say: ""Okay, get two months, when don't have to do anything else",Per-Olof-Arnäs
874,""" So they were actually funding my PhD thesis",Per-Olof-Arnäs
875, I got December and January 2006-2007 and finished the thesis,Per-Olof-Arnäs
876," It took two months, and I defended it in 2007 - eleven years after I started",Per-Olof-Arnäs
877," Maria: But I'm really impressed, because you decided to do it -- and you did it",Per-Olof-Arnäs
878, PO: It was then or never,Per-Olof-Arnäs
879, Because I was quite comfortable in the industry,Per-Olof-Arnäs
880," And then I worked at that organization for a number of years, and I started to work together with the university",Per-Olof-Arnäs
881," Instead of being a PhD student, I now started projects together with them",Per-Olof-Arnäs
882," We hired a PhD student, we started looking into different areas",Per-Olof-Arnäs
883, Maria: Did you maybe get funding as well? PO: I applied for funding together with the university for one PhD student in a project that was mutually published between us,Per-Olof-Arnäs
884," I kept the relationships - I went there for coffee, we had a lot of fee where we sit and drink a lot of coffee in the afternoon, everybody loves it, and that's where you meet all the nice people",Per-Olof-Arnäs
885, I kept the relationships and in 2011 I went back,Per-Olof-Arnäs
886," They had an open spot as a senior lecturer, and I applied for it and I got it",Per-Olof-Arnäs
887," So since then I'm back at Chalmers, doing a lot of different things",Per-Olof-Arnäs
888," But those eight years that I had an industry are priceless for me, because I'm very much unique in that manner",Per-Olof-Arnäs
889," I've been in academia, then I've been in industry, and then I'm going back to academia with the network and with the knowledge",Per-Olof-Arnäs
890, And you cannot learn that in the book - you have to do it,Per-Olof-Arnäs
891," Maria: Looking back when you had your PhD and, of course, you were already consulting, and then you started working with that company even more: what kind of skills did you bring from academia to that company that they found really useful? PO: Teaching",Per-Olof-Arnäs
892," Maria: Teaching?! PO: Yes, I was already doing a lot of teaching",Per-Olof-Arnäs
893, At Chalmers a lot of students teach,Per-Olof-Arnäs
894," We gave lectures even, not only supervisions and things like that",Per-Olof-Arnäs
895," Back then, at least",Per-Olof-Arnäs
896," Now, it's more or less just the lecturers and the professor who give lectures",Per-Olof-Arnäs
897, PhD students did a lot of the teaching,Per-Olof-Arnäs
898, I had experience in teaching and my main skill sets is to whip up the PowerPoint presentation in 5 minutes - that will blow everyone's mind,Per-Olof-Arnäs
899, I did a lot of teaching when I was in industry,Per-Olof-Arnäs
900, We had a lot of haulage companies that needed education in environmental transportation,Per-Olof-Arnäs
901, I did all of those,Per-Olof-Arnäs
902, Maria: Was that something that you knew that you were going to do? PO: Yes,Per-Olof-Arnäs
903, And then I brought with me contacts also,Per-Olof-Arnäs
904," I also brought with me a vocabulary: I could talk to universities, I could talk to other researchers, and I could understand them, and they could understand me",Per-Olof-Arnäs
905," I knew the codified language, so to speak",Per-Olof-Arnäs
906, That was a real asset in building relationships,Per-Olof-Arnäs
907," Maria: And then going back to academia: What did you bring back from the industry? PO: Some efficiency, I think, which I'm struggling with now I am in a large organisation which is extremely bureaucratic",Per-Olof-Arnäs
908," We were two people in my previous organisation, so we outsourced some things",Per-Olof-Arnäs
909," Now I have to fill out forms, I have to scan receipts, do all of these things",Per-Olof-Arnäs
910, There are policies and rules and regulations for everything,Per-Olof-Arnäs
911," Of course, this keeps a lot of people employed, which is sort of a good thing, but it keeps me from doing what I really want",Per-Olof-Arnäs
912, That can be really frustrating,Per-Olof-Arnäs
913," Not only for me,who had been in industry, I think, it frustrates a lot of people -- the bureaucracy of universities",Per-Olof-Arnäs
914," Maria: Are there any other differences that you can see between academia and industry? PO: Of course, in industry you have you have your money",Per-Olof-Arnäs
915, In universities you have tax money,Per-Olof-Arnäs
916," And it is a different way of looking at what you spend, how you spend, and so on",Per-Olof-Arnäs
917, So there are differences in culture in industry and academia,Per-Olof-Arnäs
918," Maria: How does that express itself, do you think? PO: You can see it here in Almedalen, where we are now, where there is a lot of public money spent during this week",Per-Olof-Arnäs
919," And industry is also spending money, but they are doing it differently",Per-Olof-Arnäs
920," They are doing it more targeted, not that broad like the public organisations",Per-Olof-Arnäs
921," Maria: They are expecting outcomes? PO: Yes, they are a result-oriented",Per-Olof-Arnäs
922, Which I I think is a good thing,Per-Olof-Arnäs
923," I haven't done my last tour in industry, I want to go back someday, yes",Per-Olof-Arnäs
924," Maria: But looking back; what was kind of the biggest career decision for you? Was it to leave, or to go back? PO: I think all of these decisions have been, in retrospect, big decisions",Per-Olof-Arnäs
925," To do the PhD; I have my friends, they have done completely different careers, in industry",Per-Olof-Arnäs
926," Good careers, many of them",Per-Olof-Arnäs
927, There was one big decision,Per-Olof-Arnäs
928," In one way, my thesis became much, much better, being marinated for a number of years",Per-Olof-Arnäs
929, So I'm really proud of my PhD thesis,Per-Olof-Arnäs
930, It would not have been that good if I had done it in 2003,Per-Olof-Arnäs
931," But on the other hand, it would have passed and I would have been approved and would have been a doctor",Per-Olof-Arnäs
932, But then I think I would have left for industry actually,Per-Olof-Arnäs
933, Maria: Yeah you may not have come back,Per-Olof-Arnäs
934, PO: No,Per-Olof-Arnäs
935, Maria: ,Per-Olof-Arnäs
936, to academia,Per-Olof-Arnäs
937, PO: No,Per-Olof-Arnäs
938, I would have left for industry and I would have stayed in industry,Per-Olof-Arnäs
939," So because I had my, sort of, two months left, I kept in touch with the University",Per-Olof-Arnäs
940, Maria: That is really interesting,Per-Olof-Arnäs
941," So Tina Persson, the founder of this podcast, she often talks about transferable skills",Per-Olof-Arnäs
942, That is how PhD students can learn a lot of skills during their PhD and find out later in life that they can apply these skills to a totally different field,Per-Olof-Arnäs
943, What are your thoughts about that? PO: Yes,Per-Olof-Arnäs
944, Several of those skills of course,Per-Olof-Arnäs
945," Presentation skills, which is crucial for a researcher to be able to present your work",Per-Olof-Arnäs
946," But also to briefly summarize something, to make sense of a complex issue",Per-Olof-Arnäs
947, Maria: ,Per-Olof-Arnäs
948,to penetrate a lot of data,Per-Olof-Arnäs
949," PO: Yeah, penetrate data and to avoid oversimplifications",Per-Olof-Arnäs
950," To be able to discuss and problematize the topic, not to oversimplify it, and and to really take a systems perspective",Per-Olof-Arnäs
951," At least for me, because I am in a discipline where we always need to take a systems perspective",Per-Olof-Arnäs
952," Which means that it is actually more important to the define the system boundary, then to define the system itself",Per-Olof-Arnäs
953," You have to know what you exclude and include, because it will determine the results",Per-Olof-Arnäs
954," I think that is a very good thing to have with you in industry, because in industry you very soon will get extremely locked in a bubble",Per-Olof-Arnäs
955," Of your own company, or your own division, or your own organization, or your own customers",Per-Olof-Arnäs
956, And it's very hard to look outside to see parallel organizations outside; what they are doing and how we can learn from them,Per-Olof-Arnäs
957," So, I give a lot of talks in industry",Per-Olof-Arnäs
958," And one thing I always end with, is to say that once every week they have to watch TED Talk",Per-Olof-Arnäs
959, And once every year they have to attend a conference which is totally outside their own field,Per-Olof-Arnäs
960," Like Almedalen, that it is a good one or TEDx, or something like that",Per-Olof-Arnäs
961," Because otherwise their brains will sort of stop evolving, I think",Per-Olof-Arnäs
962," Maria: This lifelong learning that we need to think about, everyone",Per-Olof-Arnäs
963, PO: Yes,Per-Olof-Arnäs
964," And it is easier than ever, to do that",Per-Olof-Arnäs
965, Maria: Yes,Per-Olof-Arnäs
966," Other skills, do you think? PO: For me personally, I have done a MOOC:s I have done a lot of blended learning",Per-Olof-Arnäs
967, I am very passionate about teaching and developing new teaching methods,Per-Olof-Arnäs
968," So I I have evolved myself on my own initiative in the university's development; blended learning, digital examination and things like that",Per-Olof-Arnäs
969," So I now have positions in several committees, and things like that, at university, because I am passionate about it",Per-Olof-Arnäs
970," And I think that that is also something that is needed in the industry, pedagogical professionalism",Per-Olof-Arnäs
971," Maria: That is really, really cool",Per-Olof-Arnäs
972," Now, as I mentioned earlier, you are also a fellow podcaster",Per-Olof-Arnäs
973," Would you like to tell us a bit more about these shows that you produce? PO: Yes it is podcasts in plural! I have to two, and almost three",Per-Olof-Arnäs
974," I have one in Sweden called Logistikpodden, The Logistics Podcast, in Swedish",Per-Olof-Arnäs
975," And I'm doing it on my own money and on my own time, but it is connected to my area of expertise, which means that most of our interviews, I actually do in my office, on campus",Per-Olof-Arnäs
976, And several of these interviews,Per-Olof-Arnäs
977," I meet the celebrities in the logistics industry, or they should be celebrities at least",Per-Olof-Arnäs
978," And several of these have led to deeper contacts, and even research projects",Per-Olof-Arnäs
979, So there is a synergy between what I do in my podcast and what I do at work,Per-Olof-Arnäs
980, So that is one of them,Per-Olof-Arnäs
981, The other one is about podcasting,Per-Olof-Arnäs
982, I have just interviewed you (giggles) in that podcast,Per-Olof-Arnäs
983," It is called Podgeek and I do this with a fellow podcaster, Lena Gthberg",Per-Olof-Arnäs
984, And this is because we noticed that a lot of people are starting podcasts,Per-Olof-Arnäs
985," And a lot of people have the same questions, so we are trying to address them from an indie podcast perspective",Per-Olof-Arnäs
986," We do not have funding, we do not have a media agency behind our backs, things like that, we do everything ourselves",Per-Olof-Arnäs
987, So that is the topic of the podcast,Per-Olof-Arnäs
988," Our journey, so to speak",Per-Olof-Arnäs
989," Maria: And it is brilliant, it is it is useful for all of us podcasters out there",Per-Olof-Arnäs
990, PO: I think we are doing something we like to listen to ourselves,Per-Olof-Arnäs
991," There are a number of how-to podcasts out there, so this is not unique, but we want to do it with our twist so",Per-Olof-Arnäs
992," And then I have another podcast coming up, I promised during 2018",Per-Olof-Arnäs
993, But I it is a logistics podcast and it is in English and it is interview based and it will be called Logistics rocks,Per-Olof-Arnäs
994, Because I I own the domain name Logistics,Per-Olof-Arnäs
995, So you have to put a twist on it and all the guest of course would have to choose a song to put on the Spotify playlist,Per-Olof-Arnäs
996," Maria (laughing): That is brilliant! PO: They can choose any song they want, as long as it is a rock song, and as long as it is not Bohemian Rhapsody, because that is already taken by me",Per-Olof-Arnäs
997, (More laughter,Per-Olof-Arnäs
998,) Maria: What is the biggest challenge in that project right now? PO: Time,Per-Olof-Arnäs
999,) To get it done,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1000," No, but I I am struggling to",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1001, Since I have been doing 100 episodes of my other podcasts I have been doing a lot of the mistakes already,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1002, So now I want to do everything right,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1003," And I want to do it with as low friction as possible, as little work as possible",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1004, So these interviews will be recorded via Skype or something like that,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1005," So my goal is to interview Tim Cook, Richard Branson, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Larry Ellison; all these tech giants! But I also understand that I have to ramp up to those, to interview other people first, but soon I will interview some of them, I hope",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1006," Maria: That is really exciting! PO: That is my ambition, at least",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1007," Maria: Brilliant! You are also very active in social media, that is actually how we met a few years back, our joint passion for digital communication",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1008, How do you think that your engagement in digital channels has had an impact on your career? PO: I cannot begin to describe it,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1009,"! I mean, I am a networking person",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1010," Which means that if I have a question, I bring it to the network",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1011," My network brings stuff to me, that I respond to",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1012," So, the network is something that is part of me, I feel like it is not a task",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1013," People say: ""how do you find the time?""",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1014," For me it is not a task it is it is part of who I am, my network is part of who I am",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1015," I use social media, I use a lot of different channels",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1016," I promote my podcast of course, but I also interact with people because it is fun! And it is rewarding, and you always have these meetings that you can never plan for, but that will end up being extremely useful",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1017," Every time you are here at Almedalen, for instance, you have at least one of those meetings",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1018, And when you go home you feel that that meeting was worth the whole trip,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1019, I am a networking person,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1020, And for me that is what the internet is all about,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1021," Maria: Yeah, the opportunities today",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1022,! To reach anyone in the world,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1023, It is amazing,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1024, So wrapping up a bit; I have two questions here,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1025," The first is, what is the most important advice that you would like to to share to PhD:s, either being an unemployed or being in the final part of their career, what should I think about? PO: Right down on what you said about your generic or transferable skills",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1026, Look at what type of problems are you good at solving,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1027," If you are good at doing interviews, well that is a generic skill",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1028," You don't have to do interviews on your topic, you can do interviews and almost anything if you are good at doing interviews",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1029," If you are good at using specific research tools to make sense of fuzzy data, well then that is a skill that you can use in several different industries",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1030," For instance, there is no industry now that is not, or will not, be data driven",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1031," So if you work in a digital area, you are set up for life! I mean, there will always be work for you",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1032, So look at your generic skills! I think that is my main advice,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1033," And the second one is the actually the most important one; if it is not fun, do not do it! Maria: That is a brilliant advice! PO: You should never do something because of the money or something, you should do it because you like it and you like to go to work",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1034," What is the feeling when you put your hand on the doorknob and enter your workplace? Do you feel happy or not? If not, you should look for something else",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1035," Maria: And if we are having listeners that are about to start a PhD or are maybe just in the beginning of their PhD:s, what do you think that they should think about? Do you have any tips for them? PO: First of all they should listen to this podcast, I think",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1036," Maria: Thank you! PO: Yes, but they need to learn about a bit more about",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1037," I tend to I tend to go into things I don't really understand, and usually it works out fine",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1038," It never works out as you think! But also, talk to people who are in the system",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1039," Talk to people who have done it, especially in your own field",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1040, Because the research environment today is extremely competitive,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1041," It wasn't that a few years ago, or ten years ago, at least not where I am, but now it is extremely competitive",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1042," And it is publish, publish, publish! And that means that you will work a lot",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1043," You can also be really successful, it's a tradeoff that you need to be aware, of I think",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1044, To be really good at something means that you will have to put the number of hours into it as well,Per-Olof-Arnäs
1045," Maria: Perfect! Thank you so much, PO! PO: Thanks for having me!  ",Per-Olof-Arnäs
1046,"Recently, I have been talking to many prospective Computer Science PhD students about choosing graduate institutions and advisors",Jean-Yang
1047," In addition to excitement, there is fear and confusion",Jean-Yang
1048," The confusion comes not only from not knowing what to expect, but not even knowing how to think about what to expect",Jean-Yang
1049,"  One prospective student put it well when she said that she knows how she is in other work situations, but she has never done a PhD before, so she does not know what it will be like",Jean-Yang
1050," She had been curious about things like my relationship with my advisor, my research trajectory, and whether I had hobbies",Jean-Yang
1051," She mentioned speaking to other people at various points during the PhD, but not having the whole picture much",Jean-Yang
1052, After this conversation I decided it would be helpful for more people to talk about their PhD experiences in entirety,Jean-Yang
1053," Now that I am a few months out of my Computer Science PhD at MIT and am about to begin an Assistant Professor position at Carnegie Mellon University, I can talk about my PhD experience in whole",Jean-Yang
1054, This is my version of Philip Guo's The Ph,Jean-Yang
1055,"  Like many other academics, I will say that graduate school was one of the best periods of my life",Jean-Yang
1056," I grew immensely, made many friends, and learned about the research process",Jean-Yang
1057," During my PhD, I largely got to determine my own research agenda and day-to-day schedule",Jean-Yang
1058, I developed my tastes as a researcher,Jean-Yang
1059, I developed my tastes as a human being,Jean-Yang
1060, Also important to me is that I developed some of the most intellectually and emotionally fulfilling friendships of my life,Jean-Yang
1061, I loved graduate school so much that I decided to stay in academia,Jean-Yang
1062,  But this does not give the entire picture,Jean-Yang
1063," ""Loving graduate school"" is different from loving a good meal, a thought-provoking film, a pet, or another person",Jean-Yang
1064, A PhD is about training you to become a researcher,Jean-Yang
1065," The further you are from being in an experimental field, the further this growth is about concrete skills and the more it is about existential questions of how you want to be",Jean-Yang
1066," If you want to stay in academia, you must also balance the growth with ensuring you have enough to show at the end for the intellectual coming-out party that is the academic job market",Jean-Yang
1067, This growth is painful and anxiogenic,Jean-Yang
1068," Even if you are in a supportive environment and have great work-life balance, a PhD is not supposed to be a comfortable ride",Jean-Yang
1069," The flip side is that, as my friend Alex describes it, during your PhD every day is ""epic",Jean-Yang
1070,"""  Enough philosophizing",Jean-Yang
1071," Here, concretely, is what my PhD was like",Jean-Yang
1072,  Summer 2008,Jean-Yang
1073," At the end of the summer, I move into my office at MIT, where I am to be co-advised by Mike Ernst and Saman Amarasinghe",Jean-Yang
1074, Saman pays for me to start early,Jean-Yang
1075," I spend a couple of weeks reading papers, mostly about parallelism, and report to him every morning about what I've read",Jean-Yang
1076, He gives me lots of advice about what life is going to be like,Jean-Yang
1077, Mike Ernst has been in Europe this whole time,Jean-Yang
1078," The last week of the summer, Mike Ernst calls me and tells me he is moving to the University of Washington",Jean-Yang
1079,  2008-2009 (Year One),Jean-Yang
1080," I'm recovering from a repetitive stress injury in my neck, so Saman advises me to take hard theory courses that involve little computer use",Jean-Yang
1081, I take Advanced Algorithms and Machine Learning in the fall and Advanced Complexity Theory in the spring,Jean-Yang
1082,  I get involved with and become lead author on a PLDI submission with Saman and Martin Rinard about a programming language for trading off power and accuracy,Jean-Yang
1083, This paper is pretty good for having come into existence over the course of 1,Jean-Yang
1084,"5 months, but not objectively a great paper--and it gets rejected",Jean-Yang
1085,"  Ras Bodik, a professor at Berkeley who tried to recruit me, emails me telling me his student Armando Solar-Lezama is starting a professorship at MIT",Jean-Yang
1086, I meet Armando and he sends me many papers to read,Jean-Yang
1087," Soon we are meeting and working so much I no longer have time for the other project, which was a suboptimal fit anyway for various reasons",Jean-Yang
1088," I like how much bandwidth Armando has for technical discussions, especially since he has no other students or teaching duties at the time",Jean-Yang
1089," I am nervous that this high meeting frequency is unsustainable, so I try hard to recruit other students to Armando's group",Jean-Yang
1090,  Armando and I submit a paper to OOPSLA but it is not good because we don't start writing it until three days before,Jean-Yang
1091," I also submit a paper to the Haskell Workshop about my senior undergraduate thesis, but it is not good because I don't know how to write papers",Jean-Yang
1092, My friend Jean-Baptiste who reads it asks why my blog is so good but my paper drafts are so bad,Jean-Yang
1093,"  Since I am still figuring out what I want to do, I schedule many meetings with professors and ask them how to do research",Jean-Yang
1094, In addition to Saman's group meeting I also attend Daniel Jackson's group meeting,Jean-Yang
1095, I go to many PhD defense and job talks,Jean-Yang
1096," Both Martin and Saman tell me that in order to become a good researcher, I have to flounder and fail",Jean-Yang
1097, I have never failed before,Jean-Yang
1098, I take it as a challenge to do work risky enough to fail,Jean-Yang
1099,"  January of this year I attend my first conference, POPL",Jean-Yang
1100, Martin pays for me to go after I email him asking how I can get to go to POPL,Jean-Yang
1101," I meet many people, including many people at Microsoft Research",Jean-Yang
1102, This eventually leads to my first internship,Jean-Yang
1103,"  Outside of work, I try to avoid using my computer due to my repetitive stress injury",Jean-Yang
1104," Because of the injury, I am also aggressive about working 8-hour days and taking breaks on weekends",Jean-Yang
1105," I am too lazy to make many friends so I spend my free time reading, cooking, doing yoga, and running",Jean-Yang
1106,  Summer 2009,Jean-Yang
1107, I intern at Microsoft Research in Redmond with Chris Hawblitzel,Jean-Yang
1108, I had seen Chris's talk at POPL about verifying garbage collectors using Boogie and thought it was one of the coolest projects I had ever seen,Jean-Yang
1109," I had not thought I was qualified to intern with him, but some of the people I met at POPL recommended me to him",Jean-Yang
1110," This summer, we build Verve, an operating system verified for type and memory safety",Jean-Yang
1111, I had never verified anything or built an operating system before,Jean-Yang
1112," I work hard, 10-12 hours a day, because there is so much to learn and because the project is so fun",Jean-Yang
1113, I work closely with Chris and he teaches me an incredible amount about working with low-level code,Jean-Yang
1114," Outside of work, I hang out with the other interns",Jean-Yang
1115," I live in Redmond but on weekends I go into the city, where I have two friends I stay with",Jean-Yang
1116,  2009-2010 (Year Two),Jean-Yang
1117," I continue to work with Armando, on the project that eventually becomes the Jeeves programming language",Jean-Yang
1118, My first year we started with a vague idea that dynamic constraint-solving was useful for handling corner cases that static program synthesis could not handle well,Jean-Yang
1119, We apply this to data imputation,Jean-Yang
1120, We learn over the course of 1,Jean-Yang
1121,"5 years of paper submissions that people don't care much about data imputation, especially since our results are not particularly good",Jean-Yang
1122," By the end of my second year, we start thinking that security might be a better application domain",Jean-Yang
1123, This cumulative work is my masters thesis,Jean-Yang
1124, We still have many things to figure out at this point so I am not that excited about my thesis,Jean-Yang
1125, I try to ask for an extension but Armando tells me to just turn it in,Jean-Yang
1126,"  In the spring, Saman and I start what becomes an annual off-site retreat of all the research groups related to programming languages at MIT",Jean-Yang
1127," People give research talks and we have philosophical discussions about the future of research, publishing, and education",Jean-Yang
1128," At the first one, we realize there are many more people who have common interests than previously thought",Jean-Yang
1129," After the first meeting, the professors meet together and decide to do more activities together from now on",Jean-Yang
1130, From this point forward there is more cohesion and activities like weekly PL-related meetings,Jean-Yang
1131,"  At the beginning of this year, I start telling people that I wish I had more female friends, since I realize that there are many fewer women around me than before",Jean-Yang
1132," My friend Neha Narula tells me to respond to a call for people interested in starting a graduate women's group and I meet Kay Furman, a PhD student in the Health Science Technologies program",Jean-Yang
1133, Along with a couple of other graduate women we start Graduate Women at MIT,Jean-Yang
1134," Such a group had never existed and our proposals are met with a fair amount of skepticism, more from students than from administrators",Jean-Yang
1135," At this point I still don't have many friends, so I spent many evenings and weekends working on building the organization: recruiting, fundraising, inviting speakers, writing materials about why we need such a group, etc",Jean-Yang
1136,"  As part of my acquisition of more female friends I join a feminist discussion group, also invited by Neha",Jean-Yang
1137, We get together about once a month for a dinner hosted in one of our homes,Jean-Yang
1138, These discussions and my friendships with the women in the group shape many of my views over the next few years,Jean-Yang
1139,"  During this time, I look into acquiring more hobbies",Jean-Yang
1140, I take some break-dancing classes at the Dance Complex but decide it's not my thing,Jean-Yang
1141," I take up acrobatics (silks, rope, and static trapeze), for which I continue weekly classes on and off for about a year until I realize I am not serious enough about it (and travel far too much) to make continuing worthwhile",Jean-Yang
1142,  Summer 2010,Jean-Yang
1143, I intern with Nikhil Swamy and Juan Chen at Microsoft Research Redmond,Jean-Yang
1144, They have a dependently typed language called Fine for verifying security properties,Jean-Yang
1145, I ask to intern with them because I want to take my work in this direction,Jean-Yang
1146, I spend most of my time working on a tool for stuffing proofs into bytecode and taking them back out,Jean-Yang
1147," I learn a lot, but the proofs are too big and we never quite manage to get it to work",Jean-Yang
1148," I also participate in many meetings and calls about the F* language, which is like Fine but supports proof erasure",Jean-Yang
1149, I learn a lot about dependent type systems and security concerns,Jean-Yang
1150,"  I live in Seattle this summer, in a studio apartment on Capitol Hill",Jean-Yang
1151," For traffic and productivity reasons, I take the 7am bus to work and stay at work until 7pm",Jean-Yang
1152, There is a heated vinyasa yoga studio I go to after work most days,Jean-Yang
1153," I love having a routine and Seattle in the summer and the energy of Capitol Hill at night, so I am very happy with my life",Jean-Yang
1154," This summer, thanks to Chris's nomination, I also participate in the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates, where Nobel laureates give talks about science, the research process, and the future of the world",Jean-Yang
1155, I make friends with scientists from around the world and find the talks inspiring,Jean-Yang
1156,  Chris and I have a paper on Verve that appears at PLDI,Jean-Yang
1157, We win Best Paper Award,Jean-Yang
1158," I am too young to realize that not all projects go this smoothly and not all papers are this good, so I am confused",Jean-Yang
1159," Since this is the first paper I ever published, this becomes my new standard for paper goodness",Jean-Yang
1160, It takes me years to realize that it is possible to do much less and still publish a paper,Jean-Yang
1161,  2010-2011 (Year Three),Jean-Yang
1162," Now I am done with classes, have no more routine, and have to return to working on my project I am not that excited about, so I am less happy than before",Jean-Yang
1163, I have this OCaml interpreter implementation for proto-Jeeves that I have been working on,Jean-Yang
1164," To make things scale, I implement a C backend and a garbage collector",Jean-Yang
1165, It integrates with the Yices constraints solver,Jean-Yang
1166, It is hard to do anything with this interpreter because it requires a lot of work to experiment with language features,Jean-Yang
1167, I do not feel much hope about the project,Jean-Yang
1168, I shop around for other projects,Jean-Yang
1169," I consider doing an internship in hardware synthesis with David Bacon at IBM Research, but after talking to some people decide I should not switch to this area",Jean-Yang
1170,"  In the fall, I TA a new program analysis course taught by Arvind, Martin, and Armando",Jean-Yang
1171, The professors are excited for me to help revamp the course,Jean-Yang
1172, There are four course staff total and six registered students,Jean-Yang
1173, Most of the work involves doing the problem sets to make sure they work,Jean-Yang
1174," It takes a surprisingly amount of time to grade six assignments, since each assignment is likely to make different design decisions",Jean-Yang
1175, I hold weekly recitation where three people attend,Jean-Yang
1176," All three students are strong, so most of the time we talk about fun PL topics",Jean-Yang
1177,"  To take a break after going straight from turning in my masters thesis to doing a internship, I treat myself by taking a two-week vacation",Jean-Yang
1178, I take a road trip through Romania (and also parts of Serbia and Hungary) with my friend Florian who I met at some conferences,Jean-Yang
1179," My friend Kate, who I met through the feminist discussion group and who has moved to Europe for an Erasmus masters program, meets us in Vienna, where Florian is studying",Jean-Yang
1180,"  In February I attend my first workshop at Dagstuhl, a German castle that hosts focused computer science workshops",Jean-Yang
1181, I have involved discussions many computer scientists working in similar areas,Jean-Yang
1182, I find it excitiyng,Jean-Yang
1183, Afterward I meet my friend Kate for a weekend in Brussels and we have adventures as usual,Jean-Yang
1184,"  This year, I also start to make more friends",Jean-Yang
1185," I become good friends with my ""cohort,"" the other students interested in programming languages and software engineering who I started with",Jean-Yang
1186, I also become friends with many female scientists,Jean-Yang
1187, I never had many female scientist friends before and this makes me happy because I feel much more understood,Jean-Yang
1188,  Summer 2011,Jean-Yang
1189, I decide to stay around MIT to focus on research,Jean-Yang
1190, My groupmate and officemate Kuat Yessenov tells me it would be simple to implement my language as an embedded domain-specific language in Scala,Jean-Yang
1191, Kuat makes a prototype implementation and begins to collaborate with me on the project,Jean-Yang
1192, This changes everything,Jean-Yang
1193," All of the sudden, the language has hope of becoming practical",Jean-Yang
1194, A nice story about Jeeves emerges: it is a convenient and practical programming model that lets you factor out information flow policies,Jean-Yang
1195, It seems natural and like the way to go--but formalization is not entirely straightforward and there are some interesting theoretical properties too,Jean-Yang
1196," It is great to collaborate with Kuat, who is very smart",Jean-Yang
1197, We submit a paper to POPL,Jean-Yang
1198," We work hard, staying long nights in the office",Jean-Yang
1199, I briefly become nocturnal in response to receiving feedback from my advisor in the evening and feeling compelled to make the changes before I sleep,Jean-Yang
1200,  It rains a lot this summer and we both become sad,Jean-Yang
1201," One day, Kuat leaves a fortune cookie fortune on my desk that says ""It cannot rain every day",Jean-Yang
1202,"""  2011-2012 (Year Four)",Jean-Yang
1203, Armando starts putting pressure on Kuat to return to his project so Kuat stops collaborating with me,Jean-Yang
1204," I am now collaboratorless and still haven't published anything on this language, now called Jeeves, so I become more and more hopeless",Jean-Yang
1205," A couple of my friends, Marek Olszewski and Michal Depa, leave school to do startups",Jean-Yang
1206, Marek invites me to join him,Jean-Yang
1207," I'm not ready yet, but I have significant FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)",Jean-Yang
1208," I take a class about startups and become friends with Tiffany Kosolcharoen, then a student at Sloan",Jean-Yang
1209, Tiffany and I spend hours together every week and she teaches me an immense amount about the startup world,Jean-Yang
1210,  My friends begin to worry I will quit graduate school,Jean-Yang
1211," My groupmate Rishabh Singh stops teasing me about my inferiority for the first time, looks at me seriously, and says, ""Miss Yang! You cannot quit",Jean-Yang
1212, You are an intellectual,Jean-Yang
1213,""" Someone leaves a fortune cookie fortune on my desk that says ""It does not take guts to quit",Jean-Yang
1214,""" Sasa Misailovic, another one of my cohort, has an intervention lunch with me telling me that I like graduate school the most out of all of us, so if I quit then what does it mean for everyone else",Jean-Yang
1215, I tell him everything is meaningless,Jean-Yang
1216,  Our paper gets into POPL and everyone is relieved,Jean-Yang
1217, I am relieved to confirm there is life after Verve,Jean-Yang
1218, Armando is relieved for obvious reasons,Jean-Yang
1219, My friends are relieved because they stop thinking I will quit graduate school,Jean-Yang
1220,"  During the spring I build a small conference management system using Jeeves, not because I want to but because Armando says it is important to build things to see what breaks",Jean-Yang
1221, This takes a lot out of me because Jeeves doesn't really work yet and I previously knew little about building web applications,Jean-Yang
1222, We run out of memory all the time and I have to wake up in the middle of the night to restart the server,Jean-Yang
1223," For weeks after, my friends make fun of me by sending emails telling me my server is down",Jean-Yang
1224," For weeks, Armando and I wake up with nightmares in the middle of the night that our server is down",Jean-Yang
1225," During this process I also realize that in order for language-based solutions to work, we have to have a better story with interfacing with the database",Jean-Yang
1226, I feel proud that I convince Armando this is an important direction of future work,Jean-Yang
1227, I also concede that it is important to build things,Jean-Yang
1228,  This spring I do some traveling,Jean-Yang
1229," I win a Facebook Fellowship and travel to the Bay Area to give talks at Facebook, Google, and Berkeley",Jean-Yang
1230, I attend another workshop at Dagstuhl and spend the weekend in Paris beforehand and meet my friend Kate in Barcelona after,Jean-Yang
1231,  My social life becomes fantastic this year,Jean-Yang
1232," I find the ""party circuit"" orbiting a nucleus of social Harvard and MIT graduate students",Jean-Yang
1233, I meet many interesting and brilliant people,Jean-Yang
1234,  Summer 2012,Jean-Yang
1235," I intern at Facebook to gain ""privacy street cred",Jean-Yang
1236,""" I start in July because it's after the POPL deadline",Jean-Yang
1237, The other interns starting at the same time are all Eastern European college boys,Jean-Yang
1238, This becomes my friend group for the summer,Jean-Yang
1239," I live in the city and commute to Menlo Park every day, staying on campus for 10-12 hours",Jean-Yang
1240," I work hard, building a verifier for privacy policies using Haskell",Jean-Yang
1241, I like the work but find it isolating because I'm the only person working on my project and it's not clear what I am allowed to talk about outside of work,Jean-Yang
1242," I take daily walks with my friend Pieter Hooimeijer, who I knew from research and went to Facebook after his PhD",Jean-Yang
1243," I work harder than I want to because of the potential high impact of this project: it is tied to a pre-launch project and if it launches well, this could be a really nice example of verification in production use at a large company",Jean-Yang
1244, Armando flies out to Facebook at the end of the summer to discuss my project under NDA,Jean-Yang
1245, I am so happy to see him,Jean-Yang
1246,  2012-2013 (Year Five),Jean-Yang
1247, I return to school but continue contracting for Facebook,Jean-Yang
1248, I work on my verifier one day a week and fly out to the Bay Area every few weeks for a few days at a time to continue working on my project,Jean-Yang
1249," I maintain two social lives, one in Cambridge and one in San Francisco",Jean-Yang
1250," The bigger project I'm a part of gets cancelled around February, for political and not technical reasons",Jean-Yang
1251," I feel very disappointed, especially because my verifier had been very close to being put into production",Jean-Yang
1252," I also feel relieved, because I'm exhausted from having two jobs and two social lives",Jean-Yang
1253," I make some small efforts to try to publish on what I built, but Armando is not excited and the team at Facebook has scattered",Jean-Yang
1254, We file a patent,Jean-Yang
1255,  The rest of my research is not satisfying this whole year,Jean-Yang
1256," I work on extensions to Jeeves that Armando tells me are necessary for the work, but that I am not excited about",Jean-Yang
1257, We work on integrity extensions to Jeeves that I don't think make sense,Jean-Yang
1258," What I really want to do is figure out how to extend the Jeeves programming model to the database, but I can't work on this until after we finish this other stuff",Jean-Yang
1259, I submit an uninspired paper to CAV,Jean-Yang
1260," One of the reviews says, ""I cannot believe there are four authors on this paper and so many typos",Jean-Yang
1261,""" I am not excited about anything by the end of this year",Jean-Yang
1262,"  In the spring, I take a class in the Media Lab with Ethan Zuckerman about new media",Jean-Yang
1263, Half the students are technologists and half are mid-career journalists at Harvard and MIT on various fellowships,Jean-Yang
1264," This gets me thinking much more about media, online communication, and civic participation",Jean-Yang
1265,  Summer 2013,Jean-Yang
1266," I stay around school to work on the integrity story for Jeeves, which I continue to not believe in",Jean-Yang
1267, Armando tells me it is time for me to graduate and go on the academic job market,Jean-Yang
1268, I tell him the academic job market is a big commitment because 1) I don't know that working alone forever is the best way to achieve the things I want to achieve and 2) the work/life balance doesn't seem great,Jean-Yang
1269," He says 1) is a result of how he chose to run his group, but if I don't want to put in the work of being a professor then I should wrap up my work as quickly as possible and move on with my life",Jean-Yang
1270, We are both sad,Jean-Yang
1271,  2013-2014 (Year Six),Jean-Yang
1272," I spend a month having in-person and Skype meetings with people about other career paths, for instance working at LogicBlox or Jane Street Capital",Jean-Yang
1273," After my mother reminds me I don't have to do computer science anymore, I consider becoming a writer or an artisan specializing in linocut block prints",Jean-Yang
1274," Rocky, who works on my floor, tells me that usually everyone on the seventh floor can hear when I laugh, but he has not heard me laugh for six months",Jean-Yang
1275,"  During this time, I also visit Andrey Rybalchenko and Byron Cook at Microsoft Research Cambridge",Jean-Yang
1276, I enjoy myself immensely and have many stimulating meetings and become exposed to the field of executable biology,Jean-Yang
1277, (Later I find out this was a secret interview,Jean-Yang
1278,) I determine that nothing else is as exciting to me and even though academia is a big commitment it seems worth it,Jean-Yang
1279, I tell Armando I'm ready to go on the job market and he says he already told everyone I wasn't anymore and plus it's better for me to wait,Jean-Yang
1280," I am more than fine with this, since a big issue had been that I don't want to leave yet",Jean-Yang
1281,"  After I determine that one of my main issues with my project is that nobody uses Scala for prototyping web apps, I decide to switch to Python",Jean-Yang
1282, Armando lets me take on an MEng (masters) student to convert our implementation to Python,Jean-Yang
1283, I find Travis Hance,Jean-Yang
1284, He finishes the conversion in the fall and we spend all spring collaborating on building a web framework based on Jeeves,Jean-Yang
1285," I am really excited to finally be thinking about the problem of extending the programming model to the database, especially as this is something I had wanted to do for two years",Jean-Yang
1286, I love having Travis as a collaborator,Jean-Yang
1287, We decide to submit to OSDI,Jean-Yang

1289, I introduce him to many Kendall Square restaurants,Jean-Yang
1290," During our breaks, we create Haskell Ryan Gosling",Jean-Yang
1291,  During this time I also decide to take my interest in writing more seriously,Jean-Yang
1292," The previous year I had come across a former problem set partner Carl Schoonover on Business Insider's list of sexiest scientists in the world and discovered he had been achieving my science writing dreams: writing a book, speaking about science, and even starting a group called NeuWrite to promote collaborations between scientists and science writers",Jean-Yang
1293," I had brought him to MIT to speak, which led to two things: 1) me assembling an RSVP list of Harvard and MIT graduate students interested in science writing and 2) Carl deciding I was a good person to take over the NeuWrite Boston group, as group membership was shrinking and the current leaders were moving away",Jean-Yang
1294, One of the journalists from my new media class introduces me to science writer Amanda Gefter and we take over the group,Jean-Yang
1295, We build a new group from the event RSVP list and Amanda's writer friends,Jean-Yang
1296," I spend much of my free time 2014-2015 building the group, thinking about writing, and writing",Jean-Yang

1302," I set up another visit to Microsoft Research Cambridge and a visit to the Max Planck Institute in Kaiserslautern, Germany",Jean-Yang
1303, I get good feedback on my work during both visits,Jean-Yang
1304, I then spend a long weekend in Berlin visiting my friend Kate and a week wandering around various parts of Croatia for vacation purposes,Jean-Yang
1305, I see Oslo for a day on the way back,Jean-Yang
1306, I find the entire trip relaxing but find it difficult to return to normal life after,Jean-Yang
1307,"  Our OSDI submission gets rejected, so I spend the rest of the summer cleaning up the paper and doing more work to submit to PLDI",Jean-Yang
1308, I feel an incredible amount of angst about my uncertain future as I prepare for the job market,Jean-Yang
1309," I spend one day a week doing extreme exercise, cycling 50+ miles or running 11+ miles, to obliterate all thoughts",Jean-Yang
1310, For various reasons I also spend a lot of weekends in New York and make more friends with people working on data and journalism,Jean-Yang

1315," I get some offers, accept a position at Carnegie Mellon University, and defer a year to collect myself before beginning and also to explore my interest in applying programming languages and biological modeling",Jean-Yang
1316,"  To keep myself from thinking about my uncertain future all the time, I start a cybersecurity accelerator, Cybersecurity Factory, with my friend Frank Wang, with the goal of helping research-minded people start companies",Jean-Yang
1317, After Frank and I ran out of research things to talk about the natural next step was to develop a project of mutual interest and we're both interested pushing academic research into the world,Jean-Yang
1318,  I don't have much of a social life this year,Jean-Yang
1319, For a couple of my interviews I stay with friends beforehand and they listen to my talks,Jean-Yang

1323,  Summer 2015,Jean-Yang
1324," I spend the first part of the summer working on writing up the Jeeves-based web framework work, which has continued to be rejected from every conference",Jean-Yang
1325, I get the framework to be much faster and work with my collaborators on a cleaner semantics,Jean-Yang
1326, We submit to POPL and then I work on my thesis,Jean-Yang
1327," The introduction and related work take much longer than expected, maybe about a month",Jean-Yang
1328,  During this time I spend maybe about a third of my time working on the accelerator and doing public communication about cybersecurity,Jean-Yang
1329, We accepted two teams for our Cybersecurity Factory pilot program and we work closely with them to make sure they are getting the support they need,Jean-Yang
1330, I spend a good amount of time on the phone with media people getting press for our program,Jean-Yang
1331, I write an op-ed for the MIT Tech Review,Jean-Yang
1332,  Somewhere in there I take a 36-hour trip to Singapore to give a talk at a data privacy workshop Saman is organizing,Jean-Yang
1333, Saman gets the people to fly me business class so I can sleep in transit,Jean-Yang
1334, It is my first time flying business class,Jean-Yang
1335, I am confused about what to do with such frequent deliveries of hot towels to my seat,Jean-Yang
1336,  I don't have much of a social life during this time either,Jean-Yang
1337," Several people text me ""you have to eat sometime"" after I repeatedly decline meal invitations",Jean-Yang
1338,  2015-2016,Jean-Yang
1339, I defend! I take two weeks off and then start a postdoc at Harvard Medical School,Jean-Yang
1340, I slowly ease myself back into having hobbies and seeing friends,Jean-Yang
1341, Our POPL submission gets rejected and I finally spend a lot of time thinking about how to sell the work (rather than how to do the work),Jean-Yang
1342," I learn that despite pressures to make the work better until the last minute, I need to fight to spend a long time on the writing, especially if the proposed idea is outside of the mainstream",Jean-Yang
1343, A nice story emerges about a new and practical web programming model that allows programmers to factor out information flow policies across the multiple runtimes of the application and database,Jean-Yang
1344, Our paper finally gets accepted at PLDI,Jean-Yang
1345, I feel relieved to publish the final part of my thesis,Jean-Yang
1346, And here we are now,Jean-Yang
1347,"  For those wondering what to take away, it is important to note that every PhD experience is unique influenced by factors such as the advisor relationship, institutional requirements, the funding situation (both professional and personal), and the academic and social environments",Jean-Yang
1348, I am privileged to have had a relatively supportive environment and few additional pressures,Jean-Yang
1349," My experience is most likely to generalize for other computer science PhD students at top schools, where the funding situation tends to be good and advisors tend to give students a fair amount of freedom",Jean-Yang

1352,"com/bmcbIog/about)    Starting your PhD and finding your feet  At the beginning of a new chapter in your life, starting a PhD can be daunting",Jillian's story
1353," You've got your  undergraduate degree, and maybe even a Masters, but how does this step up differ? Find out more and  get some great advice from someone who's been there",Jillian's story
1354,  Jillian Hart (https:  blogs,Jillian's story
1355,"com/bmcbIog/author/jillianhart) 2 Oct 2015                      It can seem stressful and demanding, but remember to enjoy your time as a PhD student Flickr/Tommy Ellis  So you're starting a PhD",Jillian's story
1356," You feel nervous, lost, confused and worried",Jillian's story
1357," The majority of PhD  students will already have an undergraduate degree and a Masters degree, therefore you could be  forgiven for failing to see why anyone would feel nervous going onto yet another degree",Jillian's story
1358,  But anyone who is doing or has completed a PhD will know that embarking on Doctoral research is  quite a different journey to an Undergraduate or Masters,Jillian's story
1359," Undergraduate and Masters programs often  have large bodies of other students on the course, for the most part completing the same class  based exercises and modules",Jillian's story
1360,"  Whereas, with the PhD, for at least the next three years you're the only one on the planet doing  this specific research (at least you hope — the original contribution race is a blog for another  day)",Jillian's story
1361,  The PhD journey  Every PhD journey is slightly different,Jillian's story
1362," Your journey will be constructed not only by your  research, but by your supervisory team, your peers, your institution, your working pattern, and so  on",Jillian's story
1363,  This independent journey is known to be one of the reasons why a PhD can often be somewhat  challenging and isolating,Jillian's story
1364," However, a PhD would not be the 'gold standard' of education if it was  stress-free, undemanding and straightforward",Jillian's story
1365, Who wants an easy life? Certainly not anyone in  academia!  As a PhD student (especially at the beginning) you feel confused and worried that everyone else  seems to know what they're doing and you don't,Jillian's story
1366, Fret not! This is normal and is likely the same thing your peers are thinking  too,Jillian's story
1367,"   Talk to fellow students  Speak to other PhD'ers, speak to others who have completed their PhD",Jillian's story
1368, You'll likely find that they  had similar anxieties and fears,Jillian's story
1369," The beginning of your PhD and finding your feet will be tough  enough, so don't carry even more weight on your shoulders than you have to by feeling worried that  you're not good enough or that you don't have a clue what you want from your research, what it  means, how you will carry it out, or produce a thesis so huge that it reminds of you of James and  the Giant Peach",Jillian's story
1370,"  I recently spoke to a third year PhD student, in the write-up stage, with only 12 weeks to go  before submitting the thesis",Jillian's story
1371, They told me that even now they still have periods of perplexity  while writing up,Jillian's story
1372,"  A fear that the work is simply not good enough, despite supervisors and peers telling them how well  they are doing",Jillian's story
1373, As academics (and especially as Brits) we are often too pessimistic and cynical  about ourselves and our work,Jillian's story
1374," Perhaps this culture of being self-critical and quite demanding on  ourselves is why we are one of the top countries in the world (https //www oecd-ilibrarv,orgy') for  Doctoral graduates",Jillian's story
1375,"  Don't fret, have fun  Enjoy this time",Jillian's story
1376, Enjoy the first few weeks,Jillian's story
1377," Welcome meetings, getting to know some of your  department and your PhD community",Jillian's story
1378," Also, try to use these first few weeks to establish how you work  best",Jillian's story
1379,"  Everyone is different, so try not to compare yourself with others",Jillian's story
1380, Just because someone works well  by hitting the library solidly for eight hours a day doesn't mean that will work for you,Jillian's story
1381," I know  students who have worked in crowded, noisy open- spaces such as coffee shops and common rooms where  the exchange of conversation and ideas with others helps them to be productive",Jillian's story
1382,"  In contrast, I know Doctoral graduates who have worked in isolation, burying themselves away from  all human life for a few hours each day — these people are still often social and active within the  post-graduate community, but simply cannot work on their research unless they are in an environment  without any distraction",Jillian's story
1383, Do what works for you and for your research,Jillian's story
1384,  The years will fly by,Jillian's story
1385, Remember how quick your undergraduate went! Remember how sad you felt  leaving the University and your fellow peers when you graduated,Jillian's story
1386, Enjoy your time and your journey,Jillian's story
1387,  Try to remember the big picture,Jillian's story

1416,"For many, the end of the year sparks reflection",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1417," As I conclude my 4th PhD year, which coincides with the end of my fieldwork, I decided to use this opportunity to reflect on my PhD",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1418,  What helped me thrive in it so far?  Asking people about their PhD journey is subjective,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1419, Below are the themes that I found relevant to address,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1420, Understanding other people's reasoning behind their choices and explanations of their trajectory has always generated useful questions to reflect on to guide my own path,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1421, I hope this is helpful to others,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1422,  Decisive questions  Interrogation mark in red neon light Asking questions,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1423, Photo by imone Secci on Unsplash,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1424," Before I started my PhD, I wondered: why do I want to undertake such an adventure? My answer back then still guides me today: for the love of social science, to develop more tools to better work with children and young people, to contribute to the community locally and beyond",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1425,"  Another question is definitely: what will I do after? Will I seek a career in academia or outside academia or both?   While I do not have a clear-cut answer, I believe that the answers to these questions, even if they are bound to change over the course of one's studies, have played a determining role in designing a PhD journey tailored to my needs and wishes",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1426," They have influenced all subsequent decisions I have made, such as the way I do research (ethics, methods), volunteering in a consultation on the right of children to a healthy environment, working as a research assistant alongside children in the Growing with the city research project, and applying to be a Public Scholar",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque

1428, Photo by Waldemar Brandt on Unsplash,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1429," Later in the process, I started contacting professors and subscribed to mailing lists on themes and from groups of interest to get to know the field, universities, scholars, programs and PhD opportunities locally and abroad",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1430,"  To this day, I continue receiving important news, such as recent publications, timely calls for papers and presentations through these mailing lists",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1431, It is a way to connect and engage with a wider network and expand one's horizons while sparking reflection and feeding discussions,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1432," In that sense, I have discovered forward-thinking networks, such as the Child Rights International Network (CRIN), insightful podcasts like the Critical Childhoods and Youth Studies Collective (CCYSC)'s Awaaz, and artistic, yet critical initiatives, such as the Rights Studio's Blog",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque

1435," I didn't choose Concordia University as my ""home"" right away",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1436," Rather, I looked at different options thoroughly and it ended up being a good fit for my research and personal life",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1437,"  First, I felt that being attached to a single field of study would be restrictive in terms of analyzing the complexity of childhood and children's rights",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1438, That's when I found Concordia's Individualized Program,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1439," Over the years, the program would encourage my creative inclinations, support my need for flexibility in terms of program structure and respect my intellectual autonomy, thus allowing me to lead the kind of research I am passionate about",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1440," In my opinion, four years (and counting!) can be a long time if there's no pleasure involved",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1441,"  I also surrounded myself with a supervisor (and a supervisory committee) that I have regular contact with, and who is stimulating and has a good ear",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1442," Early on, we addressed the basis of our professional relationship with transparency: do they supervise other students (read here: do they have time for me)? Are they interested in collaborating in research projects and articles? Do they have funding for hiring assistants? How do I/they like to work? How often should we communicate? Do they feel comfortable working with other professors for co-supervision and/or in the supervisory committee?  Every now and then, we still come back to make sure we are on the same page",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1443, I also feel that my program is human enough to support me if something goes wrong and needs to be addressed,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1444,"  As an institution, I also value the kind of questions Concordia is raising and initiatives it supports to innovate, but also to be more critical, reflexive, inclusive and socially/racially just",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1445," Is it perfect? No, but I guess that finding the best fit for oneself, I",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1446,", anchoring the ""what, where, how, when, with whom"", is about making the most of different factors deemed important for oneself: passion, stimulation, expertise, flexibility, timeline and goals, values, and funding, without it being completely flawless",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1447,  Securing funding Coins jar spilled on the floor Counting money,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1448, Photo by Josh Appel on Unsplash,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1449," Unsurprisingly, funding is a key factor to help me through my PhD journey",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1450," Although ""we should not have to win our salaries"" as expressed by a fellow Public Scholar, there are several resources like GradProSkills Scholarship workshops (from which I benefited) to better understand the current funding system, to know the funding opportunities per areas of study, and to make the best possible applications",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1451,"  Other possibilities within academia range from being funded by a supervisor, working on side research projects that are in line with one's own doctoral research, and teaching",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1452," I would recommend not being shy to ask professors, departments, faculties, institutions what is available and what can be done",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1453,"  A reminder though that decent work conditions, including decent wages, are not the only things that matter when it comes to graduate students' mental health or the quality of their research",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1454, The overworking culture in academia and the structural inequalities embedded in higher education are unhealthy and things do need to change,Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1455,"  Moving forward Looking back, I feel more confident that I made thoughtful and coherent decisions for myself and my career along the way",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1456," I have put in place safety nets in case I fall, but I can also see that I benefited (and continue to benefit) from privileges that make my path easier compared to others",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque
1457,"  Moving forward, I will continue to set boundaries for myself, be critical, reflective and reflexive, listen to others and speak up against injustices within and outside academia; take one step at a time and",Geneviève-Grégoire-Labrecque

1459,"Studying a PhD whilst at CERN, with Joshua Dawes",Joshua-Dawes
1460," Life after study Student experience 5th November 2019  Joshua Dawes is 25 years old, from the UK and a final-year PhD student in Computer Science",Joshua-Dawes
1461," Although Joshua is studying his PhD with The University of Manchester, for the entire period of the programme he's actually based at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland on CERN's Doctoral Student programme",Joshua-Dawes
1462,    Here we find out more about Joshua's research and why he came to choose to study Computer Science at Manchester,Joshua-Dawes
1463,"  Hi Joshua, why did you want to study your PhD with The University of Manchester? I actually did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Maths here at The University of Manchester too",Joshua-Dawes
1464, Part of my degree was a placement year and I did mine at CERN at the CMS Experiment,Joshua-Dawes
1465," While I was there, my interest in doing a PhD after my bachelors reached its peak and my team at CERN helped me to decide on a topic",Joshua-Dawes
1466," At the same time, my future supervisor at Manchester was looking for PhD students and he had the perfect balance of interests for the idea we had at CERN",Joshua-Dawes
1467,"after a short skype call, we had a project proposal and an agreed supervision team",Joshua-Dawes
1468," I got *ridiculously* lucky and ended up with an unconventional but ultimately ideal supervision team!  Can you tell us a little bit about your research? When I explain my research to anyone who asks, I start by saying that it's aimed at automating, as much as possible, the analysis of the behaviour of computer programs",Joshua-Dawes
1469," At the moment, the focus is on Python programs",Joshua-Dawes
1470," What actually happens to reach this goal consists of developing a lot of theory and then, based on the theory, implementing tools for developers to use",Joshua-Dawes
1471," These tools let software engineers:  1) describe how their system should behave;  2) check whether it's actually behaving like that when the program runs; and  3) find the places where there might have been a deviation from expected behaviour, and then try to determine why",Joshua-Dawes
1472,  The tools are publicly available - http://cern,Joshua-Dawes
1473,ch/vypr and the research is described in significantly more detail in publications listed at http://cern,Joshua-Dawes
1474,   What do you enjoy most about studying/researching? I was lucky to be able to get a supervisor for my PhD who was interested in the applied aspect of what can be an extremely theoretical field,Joshua-Dawes
1475," Of course there is a large theoretical aspect of my research, but there's an over-arcing theme of ""research from demand""",Joshua-Dawes
1476," In other words, when we develop theory we steer it by what we know is needed in our practical setting",Joshua-Dawes
1477," This generally strengthens results and adds another layer to the work we're doing: of course the main reason for doing everything is to get the PhD at the end, but you're also working on a kind of product",Joshua-Dawes
1478,"  From this ""product"" view comes a whole other area of things you have to learn about: how to market your research",Joshua-Dawes
1479, Being good at this is really hard,Joshua-Dawes
1480, Working out how to hit the mark with an audience who could benefit from your work (but whose interests are not in the research needed) takes practice! This is one of the things I love about how my PhD has ended up,Joshua-Dawes
1481,"  How do you see your time at The University of Manchester helping with your career plans? Technically my time at Manchester is also my time at CERN, and starting my career in an applied environment, which is where I want to stay, has been perfect for me",Joshua-Dawes
1482," CERN has the perfect mix of industry and academia; I can do research (engineering and theory) and publish, and then there are places to actually apply what you've worked on",Joshua-Dawes
1483,  Has your time studying at The University of Manchester & CERN caused you to rethink or alter your career plans? My PhD has completely changed my career plans,Joshua-Dawes
1484," When I first started, I was ready to be a theorist",Joshua-Dawes
1485," But now I've spent a lot of time in this world that's a mixture of theory and practice, I want to stay",Joshua-Dawes
1486," I enjoy working on theory, but ultimately what I really get excited about is seeing things being applied outside what I'm familiar with",Joshua-Dawes
1487,"  What would you say to people considering coming to Manchester to study? I can't say anything about the environment for PhD students who are permanently here, but I support doing a split-site PhD* (working with industry, as long as there's a research culture in the part of industry you work with)",Joshua-Dawes
1488, Doing a split-site PhD can be tricky,Joshua-Dawes
1489," There are different perspectives involved and, ultimately, the priority is for you to get your PhD, so you have to be careful to balance the things you're working on",Joshua-Dawes
1490," For example, there have been moments when I've been aware that what I was working on was no longer important for my PhD",Joshua-Dawes
1491, These are the moments that shouldn't become too frequent,Joshua-Dawes
1492,  And outside university,Joshua-Dawes
1493," what do you get up to in your spare time? I'm lucky enough to live in a beautiful part of the world, so I try to explore as much as I can",Joshua-Dawes
1494," This includes little day trips, snowboarding in the Alps, longer breaks with my other half or travelling for work",Joshua-Dawes
1495,"   I make sure to stay active by running and doing yoga (if you haven't, you should definitely try it - it's great)",Joshua-Dawes
1496," I can't emphasise enough the importance of being active (okay sometimes I have periods, especially when I travel for work, where the active lifestyle takes a break)",Joshua-Dawes
1497," Finally, since I live in the French-speaking region of Switzerland, I really enjoy using my spare time to practice French",Joshua-Dawes
1498, Whether it's talking to people or watching movies,Joshua-Dawes
1499, interacting in your second language is a unique experience,Joshua-Dawes
1500,"  Can you tell us the best way for a student to do a similar programme to you and what opportunities there are available at CERN? Firstly, CERN has a few student programmes for students at different stages in their studies",Joshua-Dawes
1501, My first contract with CERN was a Technical Studentship for 13 months,Joshua-Dawes
1502, These contracts last for 6-14 months and give students a good feel for life at CERN and in the surrounding region,Joshua-Dawes
1503, Another amazing opportunity at CERN is the Summer Student programme,Joshua-Dawes
1504, This involves students coming from all over the world for up to 3 months to see what exactly goes on here,Joshua-Dawes
1505," At the time of writing this, I've supervised three students on this programme and I can't emphasise enough how much people can take from it",Joshua-Dawes
1506," I like to put it at least a bit down to my supervision, but the summer spent at CERN has enough impact that 2 out of my 3 past students have since applied to come back with longer-term contracts",Joshua-Dawes
1507,"  Finally, I want to promote PhDs in general",Joshua-Dawes
1508," They are hard, but you gain experience in so many different areas and you become confident in loads of situations",Joshua-Dawes
1509, I think the main purpose of your PhD is to teach you how to do research,Joshua-Dawes
1510," For example, you learn to estimate how promising a given direction is; how to explain your research; and how to operate in an environment where your research is just one moving part out of many",Joshua-Dawes
1511,"  Besides this, I think you learn so much about the world",Joshua-Dawes
1512," You travel to communicate your research (at the time of writing this, I've had the privilege of giving talks in 4 countries and will fly tomorrow to give a talk in a fifth country), you work with people from different backgrounds (professional and cultural) and you see how research fits into the wider world (not just a corner of academia to which your PhD contributes)",Joshua-Dawes

1514,"Tina: Welcome! This is Tina Persson, founder of PhD Career Stories at the third Max Planck Career Fair in Berlin",Katrin-Franke
1515," I have here on my side Professor Katrin Franke, Professor at NTNU, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and I have listened to your fantastic seminar here today",Katrin-Franke
1516, Thank you very much for joining PhD Career Stories for an interview about career perspectives,Katrin-Franke
1517," I'm wondering Katrin, why you started your PhD? Katrin: It's my great pleasure to be here today",Katrin-Franke
1518, Also greetings and big compliments to the organisers from Max Planck PhD promotion group,Katrin-Franke
1519, It's for me especially nice to come back because I have been living and working 13 years in Berlin,Katrin-Franke
1520, I was taking my PhD while living in Berlin and now since 10 years I'm in Norway where i became professor,Katrin-Franke
1521," Why did I take a PhD? Well, the PhD came to me",Katrin-Franke
1522, So the only thing that I always knew I wanted from the bottom of my heart is doing research,Katrin-Franke
1523," I while I was doing my master, I started as a research assistant at an academy of science in Dresden",Katrin-Franke
1524," From there I move on and received a position at the Fraunhofer Society Institute in Berlin - IPK - for production, technology and design",Katrin-Franke
1525,"  Over the years, doing research, I realised, there is only so far I can go with a master degree in my research",Katrin-Franke
1526," Of course, for most of the grant applications and for most of the project leadership positions, it was required to be formally qualified as a PhD",Katrin-Franke
1527,"  Around 1998, so after 4 years as a researcher, I came to the conclusion that I would like to do a PhD in order to reach the next level in my researcher career",Katrin-Franke
1528,"  Then I travelled around the world, visiting six universities, interviewing for PhD positions",Katrin-Franke
1529," Luckily I found a position at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands, where I could pursue my PhD studies and at the same time work at the Fraunhofer Society here in Berlin",Katrin-Franke
1530,"  Tina: You have performed a fantastic career, Katrin! We could hear that in the seminar today",Katrin-Franke
1531, But we also know that you have struggled,Katrin-Franke
1532," I'm curious to know, what made you stay in academia? Katrin: Good question",Katrin-Franke
1533, There are many factors in our life that are out of our control,Katrin-Franke
1534," In particular for young PhD researchers close to finish, we all have been there wondering 'Oh my God, what shall I do now? What is next? Where to go on from here?' Because as I said in my talk earlier today, getting a PhD is only level 1 in Super Mario and in Super Katrin",Katrin-Franke
1535," At level 2, we need to reorientate ourselves",Katrin-Franke
1536," To be honest, in 2004-2005, shortly before finishing my PhD, I was not sure that I could continue in academia",Katrin-Franke
1537, The good foundation I had by then by being 13 years at Fraunhofer was that I had the experiences from Fraunhofer and working for the industry but also working in research,Katrin-Franke
1538, What you know is that either you go to industry or you try to stay in academia,Katrin-Franke
1539, I applied all over the world to find a follow up position that would allow me to do research,Katrin-Franke
1540, I was mentally prepared to go to industry,Katrin-Franke
1541, I got a great opportunity in Norway at a very small college where I could combine or use the experience I learnt from Fraunhofer working with industry and at the same time building up an academic environment,Katrin-Franke
1542,"  So my message for everybody, we have all been there",Katrin-Franke
1543, Don't cry if you cannot stay directly in academia,Katrin-Franke
1544, Sometimes it's even good to take a detour in industry because it will give us an exposure and to learn on what is required out there,Katrin-Franke
1545, With new insights you can eventually come back and pursue a second career in academia after pursuing a career in industry,Katrin-Franke
1546,"  And this is what we tell our PhD students today, less than 10% stay in academia",Katrin-Franke
1547," So when we have 100 PhD students today, only 10 or even less can continue in academia",Katrin-Franke
1548," So from the early beginning, look what is out there, spread your wings and also look for opportunities to continue in other areas of our societies",Katrin-Franke
1549,  Tina: You also mention that you had a career adviser at some point,Katrin-Franke
1550, Tell us more about that,Katrin-Franke
1551,"  Katrin: Yes, this was very early",Katrin-Franke
1552," When I decided that I may pursue a PhD, I also realised I know to little how academia works",Katrin-Franke
1553," What are the criteria to work in academia? So Fraunhofer is very much about content, it's about research, it's about solving problems, it's about delivery",Katrin-Franke
1554," But what are the steps, the career development towards a career in academia? Honestly I didn't know",Katrin-Franke
1555, It was at the time 2000 so I had already grasped that I might be able to pursue a PhD,Katrin-Franke
1556," So I was at the beginning of my PhD studies and then I got the opportunity to take a special course where young women could receive advice for instance in how to write a CV, what are the criteria for professorship, what are the measures for excellence, how to apply for professorship, and how to negotiate for professorship positions",Katrin-Franke
1557," I took this course in 2001 and I got my PhD in 2005, 4 years later",Katrin-Franke
1558,  One advice that stuck with me since I'm in computer science is that I should keep my eyes open for positions in the Nordic countries because women in technology are very much supported in the Nordic countries,Katrin-Franke
1559," So when I got the chance to apply for professorship in Norway in 2006, I tried and now I've been 10 years in Norway! Tina: If you were to advice our listeners, would you advice them to start their career development very early on in their PhD? Katrin: I think yes",Katrin-Franke
1560," Number one and now I speak as a professor, first and foremost, get your PhD research proposal out, get admitted to a PhD program and write your first paper, because then you know how the system works",Katrin-Franke
1561," Then, if you have the possibility, go to PhD research schools or PhD organisations to network and to build a community with your peers",Katrin-Franke
1562," And then I believe it's very good to know the criteria, the measures, what do you need to produce",Katrin-Franke
1563," If you have a very dedicated supervisor, he or she will tell you, but it's also good to seek knowledge independently and combine it together with the advice from your supervisor",Katrin-Franke
1564," Remember, your PhD is working towards independence",Katrin-Franke
1565, The last time you will have an adviser by your side is during your PhD,Katrin-Franke
1566," Once you are out of the door with the PhD, you are alone",Katrin-Franke
1567, Very much alone,Katrin-Franke
1568, Then it's good if you have use the time during your PhD to find ways to educate yourself to be in continuous learning so that the culture shock from PhD to Postdoc is not so big,Katrin-Franke
1569,  Tina: So what I hear a little between the lines here is 'Build yourself a network' - so that you have people that you can ask and contact if you need advise or if you need to expand your field or if you need to learn a particular industry that might be interested in your competence,Katrin-Franke
1570," Is that what I hear between the lines? Katrin: Well, I think there are different kinds of networks",Katrin-Franke
1571, The first and most important network is of course your family and your loved ones,Katrin-Franke
1572, Remember on one hand that you are very dependent on them but they are also dependent on you and your loved ones may sacrifice their own life or career just for your PhD,Katrin-Franke
1573, So having this harmony at home even in times of struggle I think is very important,Katrin-Franke
1574,  The next network I think is important is your peers in the lab,Katrin-Franke
1575," Your fellow PhDs, your fellow postdocs, you are sitting all in the same boat",Katrin-Franke
1576," From a culture of sharing within this small environment, the whole group can exceed and they can in a safe and protected environment try out their knowledge and skills",Katrin-Franke
1577,"  The next network I believe is important is in the institute, which is the extended version of the lab",Katrin-Franke
1578, And then the network that you build at conferences dedicated to your field,Katrin-Franke
1579," If you are in the lucky situation that your funding allows you to travel to present your research at a conference, go, spend time, learn from other researchers in the field, broaden your perspectives on the domain and see where others are going",Katrin-Franke
1580," Those colleagues and those friendships that you build at this time, these might be your research partners when you are becoming more senior",Katrin-Franke
1581," When you are applying for a grant proposal, when you are organising a conference, when you are writing a book",Katrin-Franke
1582,  And then there is the last network that I would like to mention,Katrin-Franke
1583," I strongly believe in the cooperation and impact of science working partitioners, working for instance with the biologists if you are in the domain, or working with technicians, those can often share with you a broad amount of experiences, technical experiences that you have just not earned yet because you are young",Katrin-Franke
1584, Listen to them,Katrin-Franke
1585, It will give you new perspectives on your research project and broaden your horizon and may give you the idea that eventually adheres to a Nobel prize,Katrin-Franke
1586,  I would say build your own trust network around you on different levels and start with your family at home,Katrin-Franke
1587,"  Tina: Now, you took a decision when you were in Germany to take the chance to move to Norway",Katrin-Franke
1588, How important do you think that this decision has been for your career? Katrin: My personal opinion is that I wouldn't be a professor today if I had stayed in Germany,Katrin-Franke
1589," For me, the eagerness to reach out started to grow by attending conferences",Katrin-Franke
1590, By being invited to give lectures at other universities,Katrin-Franke
1591," I saw so many different cultures going to universities in Japan, the US, the Netherlands, Canada and I saw that there are other models of working, other ways of collaborating, other ways of research",Katrin-Franke
1592, And then of course other ways of leading to impact and doing something that stays for longer,Katrin-Franke
1593,  I dreamed to go abroad shortly after I started on my PhD,Katrin-Franke
1594," I therefore started to read up on what it would mean to go abroad, what support networks are there for people that are going abroad etc",Katrin-Franke
1595, Also very practical requirements such as visa and work permits and so on,Katrin-Franke
1596, And also what is the life cycle of someone going abroad,Katrin-Franke
1597," For instance, it's fully normal that after six months living in a new country you hit the ground and start asking yourself 'Oh my God, what have I done?'",Katrin-Franke
1598, In my case this happened when the nice snowy mountains in Norway and the blue sky were suddenly pitch black and I wanted to come back to Berlin in the real civilization and not only live with woods and bush,Katrin-Franke
1599," But if you know that this is completely normal and that the pink clouds turn into desperation after six months and that you just need to carry on and it will be better again, then you may overcome the six months steps",Katrin-Franke
1600,"  For me it really helped to know that this happens to many and so when it happened to me I was just conscious and thinking 'Now it kicks in, now I need to carry on'",Katrin-Franke
1601,  Tina: I would like to share the same feeling I had when I came to Germany,Katrin-Franke
1602, The first six months were like a holiday and then the hard work started,Katrin-Franke
1603," But also that it was even harder actually to go back to Sweden after five years in Germany, because I had changed and so had Sweden",Katrin-Franke
1604, So I had the same process going back,Katrin-Franke
1605,  But we are not going into that now,Katrin-Franke
1606, Instead we are going to round up hear and I would like you to think about and share your three most important tips and tricks for PhD students that would like to pursue an academic career,Katrin-Franke
1607," What would that be? Katrin: Number one, stay modest, independently of your achievements",Katrin-Franke
1608, Because there will always be someone in the room that is smarter than you,Katrin-Franke
1609,"  Number two, nothing is impossible",Katrin-Franke
1610, Don't give up or don't take no for an answer,Katrin-Franke
1611," Question the no, challenge the no",Katrin-Franke
1612, Try to find solutions around the no,Katrin-Franke
1613," And if you are sure there is no workaround, then you can leave it",Katrin-Franke
1614,  The last thing is that I believe in buddies,Katrin-Franke
1615," I'm going diving and from diving I know that sometimes  if I'm deep under water, my air goes out",Katrin-Franke
1616, And then the buddy will provide his or her spare air so that you will not die,Katrin-Franke
1617," I believe in academia in particular, which is a very tough and competitive environment, you will face challenges much easier if you have a buddy that is sharing air with you",Katrin-Franke
1618," So find you buddy, support each other and build a strong team",Katrin-Franke
1619, It is a culture of sharing that will help you to make a difference,Katrin-Franke
1620,"  Tina: Thank you very much Professor Katrin Franke, professor at NTNU, Norway",Katrin-Franke

1622,It's hard to believe that I am done with my first full academic year at Tufts,Vasanth-Sarathy
1623," I know everyone says time flies, but I often find that expression to be meaningless in the moment and unhelpful in hindsight",Vasanth-Sarathy
1624," When I am going through a challenging time I rarely feel like time flies and when it's done, I don't find myself at peace with the knowledge that it went by quickly",Vasanth-Sarathy
1625," But, sometimes, not always, that expression can bring to bear something quite empowering and confidence-boosting: the idea that experiences, both good and bad, are fleeting and must be, for the lack of a better term, experienced and learned from",Vasanth-Sarathy
1626," I learned a lot this past year, and if there is one thing I wish I knew when I started is to have confidence in myself and in my commitment to learn",Vasanth-Sarathy
1627," It can be challenging entering a new environment, but I think it is okay to strive to be confident in your own abilities and experiences",Vasanth-Sarathy
1628," I am a Computer Science and Cognitive Science student, which means I am required to take CS classes and also classes in other cognitive science topics like Philosophy and Psychology",Vasanth-Sarathy
1629, I love learning new things and this past year has been all about learning fun new concepts,Vasanth-Sarathy
1630," I learned about interesting questions in Computer Science like what is the computational complexity of video games like Super Mario Brothers, which by the way was proven to be NP-Complete (math-speak for really, really hard for computers) by our own Tufts Professor Greg Aloupis",Vasanth-Sarathy
1631," For the mathematically inclined amongst us, see here for proof",Vasanth-Sarathy
1632," I was able to learn about fascinating and profound philosophical questions about our own minds, consciousness and the ties between cognitive science and artificial intelligence with none other than Professor Dan Dennett",Vasanth-Sarathy
1633," Philosophy, math, and computer science came together in a single class this semester for me as I learned about Turing Machines and the limits of what computers can do, all from Tufts' award-wining Professor Ben Hescott",Vasanth-Sarathy
1634," Ben brought a level of excitement, entertainment and humor to theoretical computer science that I have never seen",Vasanth-Sarathy
1635, Check out this news story about him,Vasanth-Sarathy
1636, Who knew humor could help with learning,Vasanth-Sarathy
1637," Apparently researchers looking into this very question did all along! Besides learning how to answer questions, I also got the opportunity to learn how to ask them in my research",Vasanth-Sarathy
1638, I explored some interesting questions around how we perceive objects in our environment,Vasanth-Sarathy
1639," How do we reason that sometimes we can use coins as screwdrivers or pens as bottle openers? Believe me, I tried it and it really works! Asking these questions and beginning to find answers to them has allowed me to travel to scientific conferences this past year and afforded me the opportunity find mentors and discuss my work with other researchers",Vasanth-Sarathy
1640, I also discovered all the great programs and opportunities Tufts has for folks who want to learn to share their ideas,Vasanth-Sarathy
1641," We had Tufts Ignite, Cognitive Science Graduate Symposium and the Tufts Graduate Research Symposium, to name a few",Vasanth-Sarathy
1642," In addition, the Greater-Boston area celebrates Cambridge Science festival every year and this year, the postdoctoral researchers from Tufts and MGH put together a great spotlight talks event at the Rattlesnake in Boston",Vasanth-Sarathy
1643, Several graduate students and postdocs from Tufts and MGH gave short talks to the general public (and I really mean general public) about their research,Vasanth-Sarathy
1644, I had the good fortune of being involved in these talks and I really began to appreciate the importance of communicating your ideas to the world,Vasanth-Sarathy
1645," So, looking back, it has been an exciting first year",Vasanth-Sarathy
1646, I thought being confident was about how much you knew,Vasanth-Sarathy
1647," If you wanted to be confident in programming then you should know Java, right? But, having completed my first year (and learning Java), I am humbled by the discovery of all the new things I must now learn",Vasanth-Sarathy
1648," It appears as I learn, the amount there is left to learn keeps growing, and growing at a faster and faster rate",Vasanth-Sarathy
1649," As daunting as this sounds, I began to realize that this is a good thing",Vasanth-Sarathy
1650, It means I can now shift my focus from maximizing what to learn to instead optimizing my learning process,Vasanth-Sarathy
1651," Being confident is not about how much you know, but about your commitment to learning and the quality of your process of learning",Vasanth-Sarathy
1652," I am looking forward to the summer, when I get to dig a bit deeper into my research, work with and mentor some talented undergrads, and build robots! Happy summer!  ",Vasanth-Sarathy

1654,"00 BST | Posted by Jack Leeming I Category: Academia, Blog, Career paths,  Chemistry, Mobility, PhD, Research, UK  The initial stages of a PhD can be daunting",Jack's story
1655," Fortunately, there are a few ways you can make the  transition into productive doctoral study as smooth as possible",Jack's story
1656," Whether you're starting a PhD fresh out of undergrad or after many years of employment, the  decision to begin a doctorate is a significant career move",Jack's story
1657," When I started, 18 months ago, I  figured I had a pretty good idea of what I was getting into: I'd previously worked in industry,  completed a Master's degree, and worked as a research assistant in another lab",Jack's story
1658,  But I soon realized that my PhD was different — in a number of ways — from what I'd done before,Jack's story
1659,"  Here are some things I've learnt so far, and some ways I‘ve made efficient use of my brief time as  a PhD student",Jack's story
1660,   Preparing for your PhD Do some presearch  Having some experience of the topic you're about to spend several years of your life studying will  help your cause significantly,Jack's story
1661, This is especially important if your PhD topic is a departure from  any previous research experience at Master's level or elsewhere,Jack's story
1662, Ask your supervisor how you can  prepare in order to hit the ground running,Jack's story
1663," At a minimum, this will include understanding the most  commonly used techniques in your lab, and mastering the fundamental concepts applicable to your  project",Jack's story
1664,"  Organize your admin  A sizable proportion of your time will be spent writing, creating presentations and generally doing  work outside the lab",Jack's story
1665, Deciding how you store and organize this from the get-go is essential,Jack's story
1666,"  Backing up work to a server will, at some point, prevent a serious headache",Jack's story
1667, Get into the habit of  noting down everything — even seemingly irrelevant events can turn out to be important,Jack's story
1668," Also, track your spending from the  very beginning by keeping up-to-date records of everything you purchase; consumables, equipment,  travel costs, the lot",Jack's story
1669," Congratulations, you're now the scientist-accountant you always dreamt of  being",Jack's story
1670,  Be realistic  Enter your research with a realistic mind-set as to what can actually be achieved — it's unlikely  you'll                                  revolutionize your field in a few years of doctoral study,Jack's story
1671," Balancing this realism with a desire to  make a unique contribution to knowledge helps manage your own expectations, and is the key to  making continued progress",Jack's story
1672," You can't do everything! After you've started Set clear ‘no further’ markers  During a PhD, time is precious",Jack's story
1673," Occasionally, things just don't work, even after significant time  and effort spent",Jack's story
1674, It's human nature to persevere with things we really want to resolve,Jack's story
1675," However,  this can be dangerous — before you know it, six months have gone by and you're no closer to getting  that technique to work",Jack's story
1676," Consider how necessary a piece of work actually is, and try to compromise",Jack's story
1677,"  For each project, set clear ‘no further’ markers — the maximum time, funding or number of attempts  you'll allow for something that isn't producing",Jack's story
1678, Don't throw good time after bad! Knowing when to  move on is essential for long-term productivity,Jack's story
1679,  Take the initiative  Undergrad this is not; no one is going to hold your hand through the next few years,Jack's story
1680," Though your  supervisor is there to guide you, they will not be the one doing the work, and ultimately you're  responsible for driving the project",Jack's story
1681, Take the initiative and make things happen,Jack's story
1682,"  Read  No one expects you to read every single published paper in minute detail, but it should feel like  you're coming close",Jack's story
1683," New work is constantly being published, and in an ever-changing research  landscape, you need to be aware of any significant developments in your field",Jack's story
1684, Try to read and  digest two or three interesting papers per week at the least,Jack's story
1685, Journal clubs are a good place for  discussion,Jack's story
1686," Also, read up on topics that fall slightly outside your own",Jack's story
1687, It pays dividends to have  a well-rounded knowledge base,Jack's story
1688,"  Don't be afraid to say no  When you begin your PhD, there'll be opportunities abound",Jack's story
1689," If you think that becoming involved in a  new project or opportunity will distract you from your primary interest, don't be afraid to turn it  down",Jack's story
1690, Staying focused on what inspires you will keep your productivity high and your work at its  best,Jack's story
1691,  Become more than your PhD  The post-PhD job market sucks,Jack's story
1692," While an impressive publication list is valuable, employers of all  kinds want candidates that can bring more",Jack's story
1693," Get involved in clubs at your institution, write a blog,  work abroad — the possibilities are vast",Jack's story
1694, Cultivate your own opportunities and set yourself apart from the  crowd,Jack's story
1695,"    Above all, enjoy it! A PhD is the first step on the ladder to becoming an independent academic, and  the unique freedom it provides is liberating",Jack's story
1696," Use this freedom productively and, with a bit of  luck, your results will speak for themselves",Jack's story
