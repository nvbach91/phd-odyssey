yeah yeah so what's was is it that that your work actually is the reason why you wanted to start your phd 

can you repeat the question

is it like the work that you've done before yes before your phd is the most the biggest motivation of why you wanted to do a phd 

no i i i i was interested in the research server in research field and i even didn't know much about the computational linguistic parts so i just started to work in projects and see okay this is interesting and there is a gap that maybe can be covered with my my idea of thesis and right right yeah so yeah 

so you you are doing some the kind of exploratory yeah so you you would explore more things more things like if they seem interesting to you yes i just keep doing that right yeah but now you are really a pretty relatively mature stage of your pg right yes so i think you have you have already the vision of how this would end yeah yeah that's very really good yeah so well what does the phd mean to you like is it like some some kind of life decision 

no no maybe because i started to work too early in in and it's called consultants consultancy this kind of companies the big the big four companies or i started to work when when i was 18 because i have a grant a specific grant to work and study at the same time in a famous one that spanish a spanish company that that you know for that is oriented for that kind of thing so like and so on but the same and i started to work and i realized okay this is okay and i want to continue my studies and i did the two years more of the of the degree and then i realized okay i don't want to come back to the to work i want to at least one year of master because i i already known that that in in the future a master is going to be worse because i for me worse for me because it's going to be harder for me in the future i didn't want to study and that's what that's true because for me monday master i like it a lot but it was very heterogeneous the master was artificially intelligent about artists and you you have you covered in artificial intelligence computational linguistics computer vision computer vision um there are a lot of things and you have to study to prepare and i was i was tired of that it was my last year of studying and say okay i i want to move to the phd okay it's just interesting and the thing is that finally and also from my experience i have seen is that finally the companies that didn't have this kind of knowledge and they have the potential because they have human resources they have a lot of human resources but they don't want to invest that time they want to do the traditional things generate revenue yes but they can move to these specific topics and generate this but no finally they don't have this specific fields or a specific knowledge yeah honest nice 

so most of your work is is your initiative right nobody told you to like do this did someone suggest this topic no to you no 

no it comes from the from the experience of the from the projects okay

so your background is actually like industrial right then you move to you move to that's right so what do you think is is the added value of your work later on when when your phd is finished like you expect people to use your tool and you know you mean like provide provide with the policy yes police with with the the tool to analyze the documents and then the journalists to to have better recommendations 

yes i think since my expectation is to improve this in this part because as usual you have in yourself that and most of the things have could be improved or could be automatically automatized and also i can combine now with all the information i have that of rules and machine learning and also i see myself as a a middleweight in between the the academy and the industry and the industrial part i more than innovation the innovation part that when you i realized that i was i have been working in a lot of projects and i came from the industrial part and also know that the the state-of-the-art things on the academia i know the gaps that the the academia is not covering in the in the in the in the companies in this kind of scenarios that are the academia is more for thinking about things yeah experimenting especially mental and industrial they don't have this kind of experimental they have true real cases of true real scenarios and that provides has provided me a lot of information about that about how to so this is my my idea that finally my my main contributions i want to be exploited but i'm going to and maybe i'm going to be adapted very well to scenarios of companies yeah 

so when you will close the gap of crimea and yeah both sides like step standing on both sides are there yeah so who are the most important people you work with here in in your phd and do they do they have a kind of influence over your decisions 

not so many maybe some linguistics that i have been working with and and so on but and 

what your supervisor is doing let's see taken care of you 

some more more or less oh this will be anonymized off off record no it's the problem is that first one of my supervisors is the image of the group once a year so and the other supervisor other one has really has read a lot of my my preliminary papers my preliminary work to accurate it but so on but yes 

did you have like a trade-off between like you really wanted to do something no but no because of a person that you had to like comply to his or her preferences 

no no no i have as i told you the motivation of the my thesis appeared when i realized that there is a gap in the and during the three projects was the same the panel papers the other reaction they were also the drug agency and the police they always tell me the same day that i am doing name entities ah but i don't want this why not i know this is not a person this is not a this is not a true person that i want this is not a true disease that i want or this is not a true company that i want and what it wasn't interesting to say okay why there's nothing about in the literature to see that kind of things there's nothing to classify or prune the the name entities that i'm taking yeah 

so you are looking at a really unexplored area 

yeah i think so and covering the gap that is more real in the scenarios of the industry industrial companies because these are the real scenarios of these these companies and for instance in my area to identify new entities the the most used the most used corpus the most collection of documents are from 2002 and 2003 in a conference continental and they are being worked and they are talking about they are newspapers of sentences so they are very simple they are they are they are okay but not so with so many information the problem is to apply in a real scenario in which you know what there are heterogeneity in the documents there are multi-lingualism documents there are noisy texts because having as you have seen the emails and there are noise there are things that are not being covered but this is the reality so this is 

do you think spanish is better to analyze than english or vice versa 

no i think but i think the in english there are other things of course but also spanish has is one of the most popular languages around the world because all the south america is also creating they have i have the lucky part of the work in this in these two domains and with this kind of two languages and and to know these these two languages because they are the the most common and more ones that of course and is have been working a lot in computational linguistics but i cannot even with a comment so

throughout your four years of phd have you ever have kind of moment of revelation that you something popular in your head and then you move all your effort to that toward that direction 

yes when i at the middle of my phd was when i realized this because i during the phd i created all this i work in all these projects and so on i applied but i i work in and spread it and when i was starting my in the middle of my second year was the the moment when i say okay i want to do the the theoretical thinking about why to do that and why why what's the name of this why i'm not doing this why not and so on and i i was thinking about this this is the moment of relation okay okay this is the problem of the the gap that i have to cover this is the i think the the things that have seen in the scenarios that i have been working and also and why why not to do other things because for instance why not to cover to identify them entities and then create another process to to eliminate that okay i was thinking about and i say okay i have to propose these these things and so on right 

so that's that's really really a big shift yeah kind of you said but was that in in the middle of your pages which is like 

yes the end of the second year and the the middle of the second area okay and also was the best year because i when i published the a lot of things i bought them two more the biomedical papers and the two biomedical papers about the the data of the biomedical domain this i published in the in that year was was very nice the problem is that the other ideas have been working also in one of the projects

a couple more questions do we have any other academic activities besides research do you teach or do 

well i have teach but just few lessons not so much 

okay just feel like it's nothing like to enter into interfere with 

no the lessons because now we are always in this group we are always doing small seminars talks so we are very used to present things or present i don't know of course the extent diamond but the i think the most difficult part is that for me the projects i have been working in a lot of places like 

i think because usually universities like take take the students phd students as they teach

yes that's the first day now in in official grants here in spain they have a limitation of maximum number of our time okay but they have a minimum yeah this is small but they have a maximum because of because of the problems 

i do think that teaching helps you yes in a way in a way 

yeah i think so and also this was this teacher was the i have presented two lessons in in his school because he's not he's not from this school and it has been very good for me because to improve my my knowledge of the area yeah

what do you like the most about doing a phd 

well i don't know maybe maybe the knowledge maybe for me is the the knowledge of the type of work that i have been doing 

you mean like non-non-metonic

non-monotonic and also the here is not monotonic because it's my freaking cause everything but it's interesting the way that they you are forced to do a lot of things you are forced to know a lot of things and and you have to force yourself yeah not like everyone somebody someone was forced to see yeah yeah so and you have to force yourself and you have the flexi more you have a more flexible timetable and so on that's not true because finally i work every day 12 hours but the the but it's interesting to say it's different from the from other people in the yeah you 

you know like when when you move from industry to to research you have to like you have this this graph right the y-axis you have finance which is yeah like this portion of graph you have high financial rewards but none not to zero yeah or a little flexibility but but then when you move to research it's completely different it's the other another way the other way yeah the other side will apple but and in the middle of something jobs like engineering and such right so flexibility i think is one of the perks yeah yeah but i feel like you have to like manage yourself 

and also they have things that other people in other companies cannot do for example to go to a conference to another country to one european project to another country or 

you have to be really good at that in order to have some kind of allowance but here in india academia is kind of really fair safe environment and you can try things fail and try things that fail trying to fail again but then you eventually will succeed right yeah but nobody will like you're fired no you're fired you have to keep trying but in industry you have you have one or two chances um have you ever have you like experienced the the the worst part of phd which is like having having papers rejected and feel bad

i don't know because i have just survived the worst part of the thesis and i don't know how to answer that question right now because it has been very very hard for me very hard but i know maybe in two years maybe i can say something about it was worth to support that or was okay 

do you have a journal where you write things about about your journey you mean like when i when i do do a lot of research about people how people are are experiencing their phd they usually have like a blog yeah on the internet or something 

yeah i i tried to do but this was impossible yeah it's because of time the way that we work is not possible to because normally our boss is white's emails for this week for everybody sorry for this night so maybe you are working and something appears something appears something up here and you have to change your schedule time so as you can you can have a report yes but finally this is always true is always this is difficult yeah for instance today i have i have to write that today where they were deliverable for european project and i have not stopped 

i mean have you considered like at the end of your phd write a really long article about your phd from start to end because some people do that 

no no no 

what what are your like insight for pud or what would you like improve the phd life

to improve it this is helpful to be a record but to prove that phd life you have to have better persons with people working on phd yeah because i have you know i'm not here and this is important to say that not in this group particularly but i have met people that in even in a normal world and not industrial because even in a work normal work couldn't have survived to the way they are so and you are here taking money from the state and not working at all so not working or or taking benefit of the things that the other one wants to i'm not i i claim that it's not from here but people is the most important part of the and the way that they they consider to do a phd because the idea of when i finish my phd even they i have another phd students i'm not going to i will try my not to to not be as as much as possible to not experience the same things that i have in spanish yeah like 

so yeah learning from other people is like a crucial part of the phd so so the notion of like people talking about phd is like it's very isolated it's very lonely it's not it's not it's not true but 

depends for me yes i have been isolated this is the this is the the most problem the most problematic thing here because i'm the only one as you have seen over i don't know if we have seen other ones and the only one in computational linguistics here well i know you don't have metal cards oh no no this is another one but he is also from from ocean computational linguistic but all the area and we are both covering everything so there is a time that we are tied because everything that appears in computational linguistic part and now they are this is a computational linguistics are very important now in research and also in a lot of projects they take us from efforts from us so it's an effort an effort and so on yeah 

so like the whole group of oeg here is consistent for several groups but do you like the the the the group that only has one well there are three in fact there are three but from different years i mean now the my area has been reinforced right but when i started i didn't have any one from my gallery and colorblindness started also it's a very good one and also there's maria no not this one another one that is also working now in parts of but still needs from to have strengths in this in this area yeah 

so mostly you have to initiate it all begins from your initiative yeah well if you you don't like try to step up the comfort zone and try and contact other people then then i think you're doomed yeah more or less yeah so thank you for the interview
