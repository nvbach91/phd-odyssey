So I started my own PhD back in 2003.. .which is almost 15 years ago which is a

little bit scary now... but anyway I started my PhD in physics in 2003 and

initially my project was supposed to be a collaboration between two different

departments. So someone from another department (anther PhD student) was

providing samples and then I was supposed to do various kinds of analysis

on these... and I started with very high expectations both of myself and of the

PhD program in general... I think this is true of most PhD students; nobody

starts with low expectations... so I started working didn't really know what

I was doing and the first year it was kind of a struggle and it ended up with

the PhD student I was collaborating with from the other department leaving but

nobody had actually told me... so I was left in this situation where I was

sending emails but getting no replies and it looked like my PhD would be

pretty screwed... so at the end of my first year, start of the second year, I was  shifted

on to a different project... entirely different project - some of the same

skills but it basically meant learning some really new stuff starting again

from scratch and again didn't really know what I was doing but I kind of

maintained these high expectations of myself I still wanted to do well and

things went on it was a very difficult project because it was instrument

development and things kept breaking down and it got to my third year so the

final year of funding and the pressure had really really really started to

build I didn't have any publishable results whereas all the other PhD

students in my research group were publishing papers and it really looked

like they were going to finish on time but I might not finish ever and so I had

this level of stress that was just building and building and building and

building I was going into work every day but not really engaging

so I was stressed I really wanted to do well but I wasn't working in a very very

good way I was undermining myself by

procrastinating by as I said showing up late and not really engaging with the

problems that came up so got to maybe halfway through my third year I was

working in the lab and doing these very very very delicate sample preparation

techniques it took two or three days to get things ready to actually run an

experiment and at the very final stage I had these little things and I dropped

him so if I basically ever hadn't gone into work that day I would have been

further ahead than but I actually was as a result of the work that I had done

it wasn't the first time that this kind of thing happened it happened several

times throughout the course of the PhD but this time something inside me kind

of broke as so it wasn't just the samples that broke it was something

inside me so all that tension that had been building up suddenly had kind of

just snapped and my swore loudly stormed out of the lab and didn't know if I was

going to come back so I walked across the campus thinking I can't take this

anymore I can't take all this stress I can't take this constant feeling that

I'm not living up to the standard that I expect of myself or that anybody else

expected me and I thought well maybe I should just quit maybe I should

find some some other job I didn't quite know what I wanted to do but I figured

well you know I will find something and whatever it is it can't be as bad as

they say can't be as stressful as this so then I started thinking well okay if

I quit then obviously I've got to tell my

supervisor he'll be disappointed I guess but I think you'll understand I'll have

to tell my family my friends my colleagues who me up some of him and

become very close friends but again if they're disappointed I think they will

understand and so I sat on a bench on the campus for a little while just

thinking about this and I thought well okay quitting quitting is an option and

it's not a terrible option but I don't quite want to leave yet so

few things I can try in a lab so today I'll go back to lab and try these things

and if they don't work then I'll quit but I want to make sure that if this is

going to determine whether I leave or whether I stay I at least want to make

sure that I've given it my best shot and for once I'm gonna put all of myself

into the work and so I sat there for a little while longer

built up my resolve calm down a little bit went back to the lab and just slowed

down did things basically as carefully as I

could without really worrying about the end result

so that pressure to perform that pressure to get the results I wasn't

really worried about it anymore because I could leave my self-esteem was no

longer tied up in how well I did and so I took my time did things as carefully

and as meticulously as I could and then the experiments worked so obviously then

I thought shit now I can't quit so

taught me was that the way I'd been dealing with my stress the way I'd been

approaching the PhD I've been constantly undermining myself because I put myself

under so much pressure I couldn't think creatively I couldn't take care of the

work because so much of myself was was somewhere to my self-esteem was invested

in it so by just relaxing but then doing things as carefully as I could

doing things with a lot of effort but without worrying about the end result

things started to come together then I applied this to all of the rest of the

experiment for the rest of the time that I had left and I applied it to the

writing of the thesis so anytime I had an experiment I tried to put

all of my effort in in a relaxed way and when I was writing my thesis I tried to

be as focused as I could on getting it done but without worrying about what the

examiners thought and this simple change in mindset I think made the difference

between me either failing or just quitting and going on to get enough data

for a couple of publications having enough data to be able to write my

thesis then writing the thesis pretty quickly I did it in just three months

but to a standard that the examiners thought was one of the best that they

had ever ever read and I passed surprisingly amazingly with zero

corrections to my thesis and then went on and did a couple of postdoc contracts

and then went on ultimately to start coaching PhD students and doing the work

that I do now all of that came from basically that

breakdown where I stopped worrying about the end result I stopped worrying about

what it meant about me stop worrying about what anyone else thought about me

and that was it everything stemmed from that simple change so think about how

much you're investing in your PhD what it means to you and whether that's

actually helping you or there it's holding you back
