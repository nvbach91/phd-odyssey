Abstract
Being the highest degree programme in education globally, a PhD degree programme has the
highest requirements which the candidate has to fulfil. Therefore, studying towards a PhD
may be a very demanding, tiring and tedious experience for many candidates. One factor
which contributes to a PhD being that challenging is that it is research-based and candidates
are supposed to conduct it independently, with some guidance from research supervisors. In
addition to that, some candidates may not have enough information on what is expected of
them and, therefore, may not know how to approach it. This article is a reflection on a PhD
journey and focuses on how the different aspects of a PhD research can be approached by
PhD students based on personal experience with a PhD journey.

Key words: PhD, research, research problem, academic writing, voice, supervisor, feedback.
Introduction
Given that it leads to the highest degree in education globally, the PhD programme has
the highest requirements and expectations from students. As a result, studying towards a
PhD may be a very demanding, tiring and tedious experience for many candidates. One
factor that contributes to this journey being daunting is the independent nature of the
programme: being a research-based programme, the candidates have to do it
independently with ‘some’ help from their research supervisors. This ‘research
loneliness’ may leave the candidates in the dark regarding what they need to do in order
to meet the universities’ expectations which themselves are not always made clear
(Hunma & Sibomana, 2014). This article is a personal reflection on a PhD journey and
aims at helping PhD candidates and aspirants to know what awaits them and prepare
accordingly. I also offer some hints on how certain challenges and difficulties can be dealt

with. Indeed, one way of helping PhD candidates to understand a PhD journey and its
various aspects is to get the people who were there before to talk about what they went
through and how they ‘ate the elephant’. In this article, I will cover the following aspects:
facing the new study requirements, identifying a research problem and writing a research
proposal clearly, managing a PhD supervisor, growing from feedback and dealing with
‘stuckness’, types of support from the university, publishing from a PhD thesis and the
role of PhD colleagues and friends.

Facing the unknown
Every PhD candidate comes to the programme with some information on what is required of
them. Some may even come with a ‘readymade’ research proposal. However, I have noted
that this information is not always enough for candidates to assess their abilities vis-à-vis what
they need to do before the degree can be conferred upon them. Thus there is no doubt that
candidates will face some unknown issues ahead. Nevertheless, this information, however
limited it may be, brings PhD candidates to have various attitudes, hopes and fears towards
the programme. For example, if a given candidate has achieved good grades in their previous
studies they may have self-confidence that makes them think that they can easily succeed. On
the other hand, they may have a low self-esteem if they assume that the new study
requirements are beyond what they can manage on their own. Both a high level of selfconfidence and a low self-esteem will inform and/or determine the candidate’s work and
expectations of the support they feel their university and research supervisor should offer in
the PhD journey. Ultimately, the onus is on the candidate to make his or her way through the
new and often challenging postgraduate study environment.
The best way to approach the new study environment is by trying to have an objective picture
of one’s own strengths and weaknesses as they pertain to one’s studies. Objective selfevaluation is not easy because previous academic experiences may have given candidates a
false perception of themselves. In any case, the candidates need to be emotionally prepared
for a way which will not be smooth: along the way, they may feel that they are required to do
too much, that their research supervisors and university are too demanding and/or they are
not providing enough support, etc. Candidates may even think that they have made a wrong
choice and may want to quit. If this happens to them they should not be very much surprised:
it is a normal stage in the PhD journey. They need to look beyond these and keep their eyes
on the ultimate goal of their initiative (Nsanganwimana, 2018)

112



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
On way to reduce the weight of the requirements and challenges is to find out what the
dominant research discourses are within the new study environment by reading research
reports, published work and theses which were produced by current staff and previous
students of this environment (most of which should be available online). In case the
candidates constitute the first PhD cohort in the institution, they should find out what and
how things are done in other institutions because PhD requirements are more or less similar
in different institutions. An extensive conversation with research supervisors may also be
useful; it will help candidates to know what the supervisors expect from them in addition to
institutional general requirements. It will also help to know the kind of support they will
provide or, in other words, what they will and will not do for the candidates.
Identifying a research problem and conceptualizing a research proposal
The concept of a research problem is very central because, without it, the research is not
worth it. However, candidates need to understand that it is not any problem that can be a
subject of research, especially at a PhD level. The problem needs to be researchable,
relevant and original though not necessarily new! 1 The key question is how to find a
researchable, relevant and original research problem (Aslam & Emmanuel, 2010).
Choosing a research problem in order to start writing a research proposal is one of the
first challenging tasks that PhD candidates have to do. The image that students have of a
PhD degree as the highest degree bring many students to come up with a very broad
problem which is not practically manageable. I recall a friend of mine who wanted to look
at the use of English as a medium of instruction and its effects on learning in the East
African region (Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi, Tanzania and Kenya). Convincing him to
reduce the scope not to one country but to very few schools in two districts (not
provinces) in Rwanda was not an easy task for his supervisors. When I chatted with him
as he was analysing his data he said, ‘I didn’t know what I was talking about! Even what I
have now is so challenging to analyse’. The lesson that what matters for PhD is not the
width of the research problem but critical depth with which one engages with it is learned
after so many hardships.
Once a focus is chosen, the comes a key element determining the success of a candidate
and boosts his/her morale: research proposal writing. Being a concise and coherent
summary of the proposed research setting out the central issues or questions that are to

___________________________________________________________________________________________________
be addressed2, a research proposal is a useful road map for the candidate. However, it
does not come easy; it goes through ups and downs all of which provide lessons to
candidates and help them grow. My experience with proposal writing was not very
different: I wrote it and submitted it for examination but it was rejected mainly because
the theoretical framework which I intended to use to frame my study had not been well
chosen. I had to re-write it using texts written by a scholar whom my supervisor herself
had difficulties in understanding (I will come back to this). This experience has taught me
that reading, reading and reading finally lead to understanding.
It has been mentioned that PhD is a research-based study programme. As many
candidates may know, the completion of a PhD means a completion of an original,
extensive and relevant research project carried out in a methodical and systematic way.
Thus, in order for them to be able to bring a PhD programme to the completion, the
candidate need to be able to tell a layman the story of what he or she wants to research,
where, how, with who and for who and why. One way to check whether the story is
understandable is to write it and share it with a colleague or a friend and see whether
they understand it; if they do not, then the candidate should be ready to answer their
questions, give clarification and incorporate the answers and explanations in the new
version of the story. It is this same story which will enable him or her to understand and
make his or her research problem understood clearly. The ability to tell the story to a
layman will enable the candidate to write a good research proposal, which is, actually, the
same story but now written for academics, who will read and question every point which
is made and the way it is being made, before they can accept it as an academic text.
Write clearly: how to get there
While I have found all aspects of PhD challenging, I have realised that the one of the top
challenging tasks is to write ‘academically’ and make one’s readers understand what one
wants them to understand or make them understand things the way one understands
them. As a number of researchers have indicated, a writing process is a recurring one
going back and forth (Hedge, 1993) and the secret of good writing is in doing enough
revision and editing work for one’s own text. While I agree with this suggestion, I have
found it difficult to revise and edit one’s work: since the writer will tend to read from the
mind. In this case, he or she may think that the text is understandable for an external,

___________________________________________________________________________________________________
which may bring him or her to miss some of the things which need to be fixed in order to
make the text more understandable and meaningful.

Thus, a foreigner’s eye on one’s text is always useful. This time, it does not have to be a layman
but someone who understands the area and can challenge what and how you are writing.
Another PhD fellow, a former lecturer, a work colleague, etc. are some of the people who can
have a critical look at your text and provide you with relevant feedback. In addition,
candidates should try to read as many academic texts as possible to acquaint themselves with
academic writing which, according to Zamel (1993) quoting Bartholomae (1986), is a particular
kind of language which, according to Bourdieu, Passeron and de Saint Martin (1994, p. 8), is
‘no one’s mother tongue, not even that of children of the cultivated class’. Indeed, research
has indicated that the good readers make good writers (Daane, 1991; Weck, 2013). They
should make it a point that they do not submit to their research supervisor a text which
contains mistakes which could be easily fixed; it may misrepresent their abilities in their
supervisors’ eyes and give them bad impression that could influence the way they
subsequently view the students’ work.

Making one’s own voice heard
Including the researcher’s voice3 and making it heard in one’s writing is another important
element of research report, dissertation and thesis writing. In this regard, the candidates may
wonder whether they have anything worth saying besides or about what renowned scholars
in the field have written. If this feeling overcomes them, they may end up losing their ‘self’ in
their work, taking ‘references’ as guidelines which they have to follow and agree with all the
time. However, renowned scholars themselves disagreed on various points; they are engaging
in debates on different issues from various and diverging perspectives in such a way that there
is not one definitive perspective on anything. Thus, PhD students can also enter the debate
and contribute their ideas and the research project gives them an opportunity to do so
without fear as there is necessarily no ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ academic arguments. They should
start making their arguments for and against some of these claims with valuable reasons.
Before they realize it, their voice will already be evident in their texts. In other words, they

pdate_051112.pdf, 18 May 2018). This means having one’s own thoughts beside those of others in
writing.

115



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
should dare to be different (Sibomana, 2016). However, they should be aware that it may take
time for them to be confident in doing so. Sometimes they will wonder whether their own
voice is really evident in their texts because they cannot identify it.

How to work with and/or manage a PhD supervisor
The students who are studying towards a research degree always have a research supervisor
from whom they receive assistance in dealing with the various aspects of research. Lelieveldt
(2003) defines a research supervisor as someone who helps in writing a good dissertation. He
or she assists in formulating the research questions, planning one’s work, organizing fieldwork
and experiments, and analyzing and interpreting the results. However, knowing the amount
of help to expect from a supervisor is not always easy and may be a source of ‘conflicts’
between the two sides.

It was difficult for me to know what to expect from my PhD research supervisor. I recall my
supervisor once giving him a book from which I had to identify the theories he needed to
develop a theoretical framework for my PhD research. The supervisor said to me, “I think this
scholar’s theories can help you build your theoretical framework. However, his writing style
is not easy to understand; I myself struggle to understand him. But go and do your best and
see whether it can help you.” This remark got me disappointed and surprised at the same time
but also got me to think deeply about the kind of support I should expect from her. The
thinking brought me to realise that I was the key player in the PhD research process and that
my supervisor was just a helper who would intervene after I have got somewhere. Indeed, my
supervisor always had more questions to ask than answers to give about my research, which
helped me understand it better. From this experience, I came to realise that research belongs
to the researcher (the student) and he or she is the one who knows best about it. Therefore,
instead of telling their supervisors, ‘please tell me what to do’ PhD students should tell them,
‘I want to do this in this way; what do you think?’ In short, “students should not expect the
supervisor to be a kind of headmaster who hands out orders and expects them to report back
every week” (Lelieveldt, 2003). As this scholar continues, students will have to do the work
themselves as they are responsible for the planning and progress of the project. Therefore,
when they think that the supervisors are not helping enough, they should first check whether
they have done their part effectively. If they find that they have, then it is advisable to discuss
the supervisory relationship with their supervisors.

116



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
Nevertheless, the relationship between the student and the supervisor may not always be
smooth; the two may have diverging views about certain issues and/or aspects of the PhD
research or the way to engage with each other. I was lucky that my supervisor would always
give her opinion about certain issues which we did not agree on but give me a liberty to decide.
But this may not always be the case; some supervisors may ‘impose’ their perspectives to
students because of various reasons. Without contradicting the fact that the work belongs to
the student, I suggest that students need to comply because it is part of the supervisors’
responsibilities to guide the student according to what they believe is appropriate. After all,
supervisors are supposedly more knowledgeable in the area than students and, therefore,
there may be good reasons for such decisions, which students may not necessarily understand
at certain stages.
Things may become different and worse (maybe) when one has to deal with two or more
supervisors who they have diverging perspectives on the thesis and, as was the case for
Niyibizi (2018), it is not clear who is the main or co-supervisors. The onus is on the PhD
candidate to find a way of striking a balance in the way they deal with their feedback and
perspectives on the thesis. One way they could achieve this is to request for a meeting with
all the supervisors at the same time, which could lead to a common conclusion and way
forward (Niyibizi, 2018).

Dealing with inferiority feelings and growing from feedback
The first experiences with postgraduate studies and/or research may not match students’
expectations, which may alter their feelings and affect their response. In my case, these
experiences raised inferiority feelings, which would surface whenever I had to say or write
something about or alongside what other scholars, including our supervisors, said or wrote.
These feelings can be counter-productive, especially when they increase self-doubt and the
fear of being judged. Before they write or say anything, students will always wonder whether
this will not be another opportunity for the people who are listening to them or who will read
their texts to judge them. As a result, the level at which they filter their ideas may increase
and they may drop some important ones in the process.

Feelings of inferiority may not just cause PhD students to self-censor; it may bring them to
have low self-esteem upon what they do. Low self-esteem may make it difficult for the
students to think critically and have a productive outlook on comments, observations and
viewpoints, which challenge their ways and work. Instead of being a source of improvement
117



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
for their work, these feelings can be stumbling blocks on the way. This can happen in two
ways: they may uncritically follow all suggestions and comments as gospel truth. In addition
to confusing them (as suggestions from different people may be contradictory), this approach
is likely to limit their deep thinking. Alternatively, such suggestions and comments and
questions may make them feel ‘useless’ and unworthy for the programme. For instance, if the
supervisor says that he or she does not understand certain sections of their work they may
come to the conclusion that these sections do not make any sense at all, or that the students’
entire submission is worthless.

As postgraduate research students, PhD candidates need to understand that such comments
and observations are part of a research degree process (and of life) and help them take their
research to the next level. Instead of a protective or a submissive stand on feedback, they
should find a way of chewing and turn it into nutrients for their study and research process.
Nevertheless, coming to a point where they can chew and swallow these comments
effectively does not come easy; it always takes frustration and even ‘crying’ moments. A
careful reading of the comments and suggestions for deep understanding is one way to
benefit from these. The more these are read, the more these comments make more sense to
them. Students need to ask for clarification on these when they find that they are not able to
address or respond to them adequately. In short, they may have to admit not knowing and
then be ready to learn. They should never keep or return their draft to their supervisor or any
other person who has made comments and/or suggestions to their work without addressing
these. I did this on occasions with my supervisor’s comments but I later realized that by so
doing I was robbing my work of some quality, as well as my wasting supervisor’s time spent
giving me the feedback. These comments and suggestions could make a significant difference
if they could be understood and responded to effectively. Indeed, when I received the
examiners’ report on my thesis, I noted that some of their comments and criticisms were
related to my supervisors’ concerns of the kind mentioned above. If you are PhD student don’t
be like me: be ready to ask questions no matter how ‘stupid’ they may appear, accept
challenges and be ready to change your viewpoints and understanding if necessary.

Spending considerable time and effort in reading the literature related to their work is another
way of making these comments and suggestions easier to chew. This practice will
progressively build students’ self-confidence. In my case, this increased my self-confidence to
the point of taking ‘risks’. For example, I decided to submit two abstracts for conference

118



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
papers, without seeking my supervisor’s views as I had always done previously. These two
abstracts were eventually accepted and related papers presented. Now, the two papers have
been turned into a book chapter and a journal article which have now been published. This
initiative and related fruits taught me that if you are a research degree student, you
sometimes need to take ‘a risk’ of trusting your abilities; after all, there will come a time when
you will work on your own as an academic and other people will rely on your assistance for
their academic development.

‘Stuckness’: what to do about it
One other aspect of a research journey is getting ‘stuck’ from time to time. PhD candidates
may sometimes reach a point where there seems to be a closed gate ahead and, therefore,
they cannot move forward. This could be a result of various factors including failure to
understand a concept or a theory which they need to build on in presenting subsequent ideas
and claims; not being able to find a way forward after exhausting all they have to say and yet
feeling more is needed; not knowing where to start in order to start discussing a new aspect
or topic and inability to understand their supervisor’s comments and suggestions and/or to
know what to do about them. As much as being stuck may be a challenge, my experience
brought me to view it as an indication that some progress as being made: you have moved
from point A and have come to point B and in the process of getting to point C, you are stuck.
Being stuck can also be a source of inspiration and a trigger for deeper thinking.

In trying to unlock the closed gate, I have discovered that the key may not necessarily be in
the particular section or aspect one is stuck on. Stopping working on the section or aspect for
a certain period of time and working with what one is more comfortable with at that time is
one way of dealing with any ‘stuckness’. Working with other sections or aspects will
sometimes give hints which will help understand the issues in the section one is stuck on. All
sections, aspects, concepts and theories of a research project are related to one another to
various extents. I have also noted that it is difficult to think creatively and thoroughly the
moment one gets stuck, which is likely to prevent some alternatives and perspectives from
surfacing. Leaving the section or aspect for a while in order for it to ‘ferment’ in one’s head is
another way of dealing with ‘stuckness’ which may often be fruitful.

At times when one is stuck, they can share their work with fellow students. Since all are facing
the same challenges, they may understand each other better in both formal and informal

119



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
conversations about their studies. For instance, when I was grappling with understanding
what a theoretical framework is I overheard and then joined a conversation between two
fellow PhD students about this particular concept. This conversation made things clearer for
me because the colleagues could use their respective topics as examples. Along with informal
conversations, students can also benefit from taking part in conferences and other academic
forums for continuously shaping their research. PhD students should not just be passive
participants; they should throw their ideas in, inquire, question, friendly criticise, correct, and
explore. They need to be ready to share their work with others in such forums no matter how
inadequate it may seem to them. They need to remember, it is through comments,
observations and criticisms that their work gets improved and this is the best place to get the
most relevant of these.

The support from the University
Different universities provide their PhD candidates with various types of support which can
include one or more of the following: a PhD supervisor, PhD scholarships, PhD seminars,
conferences funding, academic writing support (such as writing retreats and writing
mentor/consultants), publication fees, etc. The more the types of support the university
provides the easier the life and work of its PhD candidates becomes. My university provided
students with carrels as a working space, a personal computer and a shared printer. It also
provided them with regular opportunities to present their work in PhD workshops and get
feedback from various categories of people including fellow PhD candidates, university
lecturers and other scholars. In addition, the university provided students with funds to
attend, and present papers in, conferences in and outside the country/continent if their
conference papers have been accepted. I remember that the first conference which I attended
was funded by the university, and this led to my first publication. Moreover, the university
would pay publication fees for students’ whose papers have been accepted for publication.

In the final year of their PhD completion, candidates could apply for a PhD completion grant
to help them with the final stages such as paying editors, printing, and meet some other
expenses especially because many exceed the completion time agreed by their sponsors. On
top of this, the university had different types of scholarship available for PhD candidates in
the different faculties. In short, I can say that my colleagues and I had privileges which many
PhD students in other universities did not have. Nevertheless, candidates need to make the
best use of whatever support is available in their universities and try to find other sources of

120



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
support for what the university does not cover. For instance, they can use their own income
to pay for conference attendance, editors, etc.

Publishing from a PhD thesis
Universities require (or at least encourage) PhD students to publish from their theses. This is
a daunting experience for many because completing a thesis itself is challenging enough. Thus,
without support from the university some students may never publish. In my case, for
example, had I not been supported and encouraged by my PhD supervisor to submit a paper
from my MA dissertation for a conference, it would have been difficult for me to enter the
publication world. She helped me from the inception of the paper to the last version which
was published: she proofread my drafts, helped me understand and address reviewers’
comments and advised me in various ways. Furthermore, the university always organized PhD
seminars whereby established scholars would cover the different steps and aspects of
academic writing and publication, including turning a PhD thesis chapter into a book
chapter/academic article. This boosted my confidence and competence in academic writing
and brought me to a stage where I could conceptualize a paper and have it published. As a
result, publishing from my PhD thesis was not very difficult for me. However, this kind and
level of support may not be available in all universities for all PhD students.

One important stage of the publishing process is dealing with the response on the submitted
manuscripts. When the manuscript is rejected, the students may feel disempowered
especially when it is their very first submission. It may bring them to seriously doubt their
ability to publish and, eventually, affect their readiness for subsequent submission. However,
students should understand that the rejection may not necessarily be due to the inadequacy
of the manuscript itself but to other factors as well. For example, it may be due to a wrong
choice of the journal/issue. After all, some articles that are rejected by some journals get to
be published by others. In addition, it is unusual for a manuscript to be rejected without the
reviewers giving their feedback which can be used to revise and improve it for submission to
a different journal. For example, one of my manuscripts was rejected by two journals, but I
improved it at every rejection using the reviewers’ feedback. When I submitted it to the third
one, it was accepted with revisions.

On the other hand, a manuscript may be accepted with major revisions which vary in types:
revision/change of the theoretical framework, addition of data or going more in depth with

121



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
analysing these, adding some literature aspects, change of structure, etc. In short, some
revisions require as much work as writing the article anew. Thus, this may be challenging for
the students because by submitting a manuscript they may have thought that they were done.
But the bottom line is that publishing is another way to learn. Thus, by responding to the
reviewers’ recommendations and suggestions the writers are not just satisfying the
requirements of the journals/publishing houses; they are also deepening their understanding
of various concepts and theories in the area. Thus, both a rejection and acceptance constitute
learning opportunities.

The role of PhD fellow colleagues
According to Vygotsky, knowledge is a social construction: it is developed and learned through
social interaction (Vygotsky, 1978) and human cognition and learning are social and cultural
rather than individual phenomena (Kozulin et al., 2003). As Johnson and Golombek (2011, p.
2) argue, learning “originates in and emerges out of participation in social activities”, which
suggests that social contexts play a central role in learning. However, it is noteworthy that
some learning programmes encourage social activities and involvement than others.
Research-based programmes (such as PhD programmes) are among those which give little
room to social interactions because students generally work on their projects individually.
Thus, PhD candidates in different university departments and schools need to increase the
opportunities of working together by establishing communities of practices which will sustain
mutual engagement (Wenger, 1998).

With the current technological progress, the contact between members of the communities
does not necessarily need to be physical; it can also and especially be virtual because PhD
candidates may not be working from physically close contexts. Different media can be used
to this end and they include Facebook, twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, etc. A community like this
will benefit PhD candidates in several ways. Since the members are going through the same
process and, possibly, facing the same challenges, they can understand one another best.
Thus, it is a place where people can share their confusions, frustrations and weaknesses and
ask any questions without fear of being judged. As has been pointed out, the members are
bound by the engagement to one another and this helps them to grow. For instance, if there
is a Facebook group to which a student belongs and where people post different things related
to the group’s practice, it is uncommon to find a member spending weeks without posting

122



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
anything. In this way, the mutual engagement keeps everyone active, which implies
progressive work (or at least thinking) on the PhD project.

By reading about the challenges which different people are facing, students come to
understand that they are not the only one finding the programme very difficult and challenges
may be normal for the programme. This is likely to boost their morale. They will learn from
one another’s challenges, failures and successes and they will benefit from one another’s
expertise. For instance, if a group member is an expert in statistical analysis, he or she can
help those who are struggling with this kind of analysis. Members can also share resources
such as references and data collection materials (such as audio and video recorders). Finally,
they also celebrate together because one person’s achievement is a community’s
achievement. For instance, when one member has submitted their thesis, it gives hope to the
rest that one day they will also make it. At the university that I attended, the connection
between PhD students was facilitated by the fact that they had carrels in the same space. This
provided them with opportunities to interact and discuss the various aspects of their work
and thereby encourage one another in different ways. Thus, universities (and students
themselves) should increase the opportunities for PhD students to meet regularly both
formally and informally.

Bid farewell to social life?
While studying towards a PhD degree, students remain social (and maybe professional)
people: they may have job responsibilities, families to take care of, friends to socialize with
and some other social and professional commitments. All these social and professional fellows
may not expect less attention than they used to get from the PhD students before registering
for a PhD. If anything, they may want to see the students not changing because they are doing
a PhD, to make sure that them being PhD candidates and, subsequently, PhD holders does not
mean that they no longer belong to the community. So how do they balance these two sides?
In any case, they are the master of it all. Thus, they need to understand that while doing a PhD
requires a constant focus, taking a short ‘holiday’ from it and engaging in social activities for
a while actually may make a difference regarding the progress of the PhD research. It refreshes
the mind by releasing it of tense and routine activity and offering an opportunity to think
about and work on something different. Therefore, they should go to church, sing in a choir,
do sports, attend weddings and birthday parties, take you family or friend(s) out, visit
relatives, or go to a night club if that is convenient for them. Nevertheless, they should not

123



___________________________________________________________________________________________________
improvise these activities; the latter should be built in their plan and allocated time which has
to be respected. Moreover, academic and social lives should not impact on each other
negatively. For instance, if a student decides to go and share a drink with friends one weekend,
they should make sure that its effects are not carried over the next day: they need to drink
responsibly. Even in a pub, they remain a PhD candidate.

Conclusion
Doing a research degree is a journey which may not be easy to take. It goes through ups and
downs, all of which have important lessons. A ‘fall’ is not necessarily a sign of intellectual
weakness and/or a premature end of the road but an occasion to rise and take another step
forward. PhD students need to view any event or incident as an opportunity to learn
something which will help them push their work ahead. They may fall and find that they need
to take a different direction when they rise. Therefore, they should be ready to be criticised
and challenged and, eventually, change their viewpoints if necessary. All they need is to
objectively assess and believe in their abilities, and use these as such with a determination to
make them work no matter how difficult the task which lies ahead may be.
